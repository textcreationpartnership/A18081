            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>My reply is that our <hi>Sauiour Chriſtes vocation, vuas to be a Miniſter of the goſpel, but he</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">LuK. 12. 24.</note> 
               <hi>refuſed ciuil iudgment becauſe of his vocation: therfore he refuſed it, becauſe he vuas a Miniſter of the goſpel.</hi> whervpon alſo followeth, that Bishops being Miniſters of the goſpel: owght not to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, any ſuch power. See now how iuſtly he complaineth, that I <hi>anſwer not to that he ſaid, that Chriſts refuſal in the partition of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritans, perteyneth no more to Bishops then to Kinges:</hi> no mervail al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if it require further anſwer, it was ſo wel garded: ſeing his reaſon ys, <hi>becauſe the doeinges of Chriſt be a patern for al Chriſtians:</hi> then which, there can be nothing more abſurd. For alt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>howgh al his doeinges, be inſtruction to al Chriſtians: yet that they are a patern to them al, draweth with it, that al may preach, that none may giue iudgment in civil cauſes, and a number more horrible confuſions: yt being alſo a fals ground of popery, wherby they would eſtabliſh the lenton faſt, and other ſuch corruptions.</p>
            <p>Vvhere alſo he would giue to vnderſtand, that our Sa. Chriſt did <hi>refuſe this, not as a Miniſter of the goſpel, but as Redemer:</hi> he renteth a ſunder thinges, which can not be ſeparated. For one part of his redemership, ſtandeth in that he was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of god vnto vs, for a teacher: ſo that, if he would haue anſwered any thing in this kinde, he muſt haue ſaid, that he refuſed to iudg of ciuil cauſes, not as a Miniſter of the word, but as a Prieſt, or King, whereof alſo the laſt, he in part ſetteth down: ſaying <hi>he refuſed yt, to declare that his Kingdome was not earthly, but heauenly:</hi> as if it were not as neceſſary, for hym to refuſe it in reſpect of his Doctorship, that he might decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re likewiſe, that his doctrine was not of earthly thinges, but of heauenly: and conſequently, as convenient in the ſame reſpect, for the Miniſters to abſtein from it. But the further confutation of this, the reader shal take from thence, <note n="d" place="margin">Tra. 6. p. 404.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7987:6"/> is shewed, that our Sa. Chriſt, by his own example, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Apoſtels and, in them, al the Miniſters of the word, from al pomp and dominion: and therfore from theſe ciuil offices, whervnto pomp and dominion are annexed.</p>
            <p>Then he anſwereth, that <hi>no man giueth the Bishops autority to iudg in matters of inheritans:</hi> whereas our Sa. Chriſt, refuſed it not, becauſe he was no Iudg of that cauſe, but ſimply becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe he was no ciuil Iudg: <note n="a" place="margin">

               </note> refuſing vpon the ſame ground, to giue ſentence of the harlot. The Miniſters (for ſooth) <hi>may not medle with ciuil occupations,</hi> but with ciuil offices: and in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil offices, not with them of no countenance, as the <hi>Iailers office</hi> &amp;c, but with thoſe of eſtate: and amongeſt thoſe of eſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te, not with <hi>matters of inheritance</hi> but with <hi>criminal cauſes.</hi> Thus, yow take your ſelf licence, to ſay al thinges, and to shew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. But to leau the reſt vnto an other place, let the D. shew ſome reaſon, why the Miniſter should rather ſit in iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of criminal cauſes, then in pleas of inheritans: they boeth belong to the Magiſtrate alike, yf he owght to accept one, being committed vnto hym by the Magiſtrate, why not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the other: eſpecially, when as by criminal cauſes, (requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more ſearch and greater diligence then the other) the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re muſt needes be greater hinderance from his miniſtery. As for that he ſaith, <hi>thoſe are to be decided by law, and haue other Iudges appointed for them:</hi> the criminal cauſes are likewiſe. And if there were no other Iudges appointed for them: yet, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there owght to be, is the queſtion: ſo that the D. anſwer, is here an open demaund of the queſtion. Vvhere alſo owt of M. <hi>Caluin,</hi> he alledgeth <hi>Barnard, that the Miniſters power is in cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes:</hi> it is a shameful abuſing, of boeth Calvin and Barnard. for they ſpeak there of rebuking and punishing ſyn, by ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical cenſures: which is manifeſt, in that they convey the title of this power, to the Miniſter, <note n="b" place="margin">4. li. Inst. 11. cap. 12. ſect.</note> by <hi>the Keies</hi> deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto S. Peter. now the very word of <hi>Keies,</hi> eſpecially with this addition, <hi>giuen vnto S. Peter:</hi> telleth al men, that the power there ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, is ſpiritual, and not ciuil. And he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the D. is directly againſt him ſelf. For before, in this very diuiſion, ſaying that this iudgment in ciuil cauſes is not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7987:7"/> but added to the miniſtery:</hi> here he pretendeth owt of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, that ciuil iudgment in criminal cauſes, is of the power and iuriſdiction of the Miniſters.</p>
            <p>And if it be trw that he ſaith after, <hi>the paſtor muſt vſe ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, as ſemeth good to the Magiſtrate:</hi> when the Magiſtrate or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deineth ciuil diſcipline onely, ether that diſcipline muſt be incident to the paſtorship, or els in ſuch a time, there shal be a Paſtor of god, which hath no diſcipline incident into his office: ſeing the eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, which is taken (by his iudgment) from him laufully, is not incident: ſo that this idle diſtinction goeth flat to the ground. I cal it idle, be cauſe it maketh nothing to the queſtion: which is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Miniſter may bear ciuil office, in that reſpect that he is a Miniſter, but whether he may bear it at al. And of this ſort alſo is, <hi>that our Bishops break not violently into theſe offices, but receiue them of the Princes gift:</hi> whereas our queſtion is, whether he may receiu theſe offices when they be giuen: yet hath he vſed this diſtinction, at the leaſt, fiue tymes.</p>
            <p>After is added, that it is <hi>committed to them by the Magiſtrate, for fuller ſatisfying of their dutie:</hi> yf ſo, why should not al the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters alike haue this power, <hi>to the end, that al might doe their duties the better.</hi> Again, in ſaying that it is <hi>neceſſary for this tyme:</hi> yow openly wreſt this power, owt of the Magiſtrats ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. For the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby it followeth, that the Magiſtrate of dutie, owght to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this vnto them: and if he doe not, he is giltie of gods wrath, in leauing vndoen, that which is <hi>neceſſary to be doen.</hi> yow doe alſo open iniury to the holy goſt, which is thus ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſed to haue left that in the liberty of the Magiſtrate, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich is neceſſary for the accomplishing of the miniſtery: w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereas, if it had bene neceſſary, there had bene alſo nothing more eaſy, then to haue giuen this general rule, that alwaies vnder a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, the Miniſter should be armed with civil autority. But this ſuccour which yow ſeek in the <hi>tyme,</hi> is Pigghius shift: as is alſo this whole cauſe, and the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of your arguments. For he ſaith, <hi>As long as the church</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pigg lib. 5. hierarh ca. 16.</note> 
               <hi>vuas in perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, al vuere obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto their Paſtors, hovu ſimple or baſe ſo euer the Miniſters vuere: but after that the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7987:7"/> church came to haue proſperity, then it vuas needful, that Bishops should be magnifical alſo, to the end they might be more apt, to gouern the magnifical Princes:</hi> and that otherwiſe his power and autority <hi>should not be ſufficiently reuerenced.</hi> To whome, as vnto the D. it is eaſy to anſwer, that if Kinges and Princes, being yet in deadly hatred aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt the goſpel, were browght by the miniſtery of the word, vnaccompanied with any ſuch pomp or iuriſdiction, to ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eld them ſelues vnto the goſpel, and to giue due reuerence vnto the miniſtery: how much more now, being friendes, wil they be kept in dutie and convenient eſtimation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, withowt this diſguiſing of the miniſtery.</p>
            <p>That alledged out of Caluin, that <hi>euery man must reſpect his own vocation &amp;c.</hi> beſide that it is drawen clea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the minde of the autor, it is abſurdly applied. For the application, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it meet for the vocatio of the Miniſter, that he should bear ciuil office: which is that in queſtion. And where he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ith, Caluin <hi>ſpeaketh nothing againſt theſe civil offices in eccleſiaſtical perſons,</hi> and after, <hi>that nether he nor any godly man, can diſalow of yt:</hi> he giueth ſuſpition that he hath ſould him ſelf to ſpeak vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, withowt al chek of conſcience. For Calvin sheweth, that albeit the godly Princes, giuing theſe offices to church men, had a good intent: yet, that they did <hi>euil provide the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby for the church,</hi> conſidering that by it was <hi>corrupted, or</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. lib. Inſt. 11. cap. 10. ſect.</note> 
               <hi>rather vtterly brovught to no vught, al true and auncient ſincerity, and that, the Bishops if they had had a spark of grace, vuould vuhen they vuere offered ſuch offices, haue anſuuered, that the armour of their vuarfare, is not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal but ſpiritual.</hi> Here again alſo, he is owt with him ſelf. For in the end of his book, albeit the shiftes he vſeth are to rowgh hewed: yet, when he commeth to Caluin, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter void of al shift, he is conſtreined to reiect his autority. Yf he <hi>haue nothing againſt him,</hi> why doeth he make ſo ſmale ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him, as for <hi>nothing</hi> to caſt him of: if he be againſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7987:8"/> him, why doeth he here deny it. And as I haue alledged M. Caluin, and ſome others: ſo the learned know that a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber moe might be browght, to the making vp of a book: but for him, beſide the papiſtes (as I am verely perſwaded) ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce one ſo bould an enemy of the truth, as to commit this to writing.</p>

Your argument, is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me which I haue ſaid. <hi>The Bishop muſt gouern with diſcipline, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with ciuil diſcipline:</hi> your anſwer that <hi>he muſt vſe diſcipline pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Magiſtrate, whether ciuil or eccleſiaſtical,</hi> is an asking of that in queſtion.</p>

And it is confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in that S. Paul inſtructeth Timothy there, not as a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Chriſtian, but as a Miniſter of the goſpel: in that alſo he borowed this ſpeach of the law, which <note n="c" place="margin">Num. 4. 3. &amp; 8. 24. 25.</note> calleth the miniſtery a ſouldiarfare: thirdly in that the ſame Apoſtle in other <note n="d" place="margin">1. Co. 9. 7 Phili. 2. 25.</note> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces giueth this title of ſouldiarship, and felow ſouldiarship, to thoſe of the miniſtery. Beſide that it flatly condemneth Cyprian, as an abuſer of the place: who by vertw hereof, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth a Miniſter an Executorship, which, by the D. ether is not forbidden him, or els is forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to al Chriſtians ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke.

The reaſon whereby Pigghius and he, would shew it vnderſtanded of al Chriſtians alike, is this. Al Chriſtians be ſpiritual ſouldiars: S.

            <p>To that I alledged, that <hi>it is as monstrous for the Bishop to goe from the pulpit, vnto the place of ciuil iudgment, as for my lord Maior to</hi> goe to the pulpit: he anſwereth, that it <hi>is not vncomely to goe from the pulpit to ciuil adminiſtration of iuſtice</hi> &amp;c, which is a mere mockery of his reader. For not daring to deny, but it is vncomely for the lord Maior: he anſwereth, by affirming that in queſtion. For if he ſay, it is not vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely for the lord Maior to goe to the pulpit, he runneth in to that, which he ſaith I ſurmiſe of him: where of notwitſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I haue not a letter. Albeit the truth is, that he may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel ſay, the Magiſtrate may miniſter the Sacrament and preach, which is the proper dwety of the Miniſter: as to ſay, <hi>the Miniſter of the word, may ſit in iudgment of ciuil cauſes,</hi> which is the proper dwety of the Magiſtrat. For, look what differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the lord hath ſet, betwene the office of the ciuil Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, and of the Miniſter: the ſame muſt of neceſsity be betwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the office of the Miniſter, and of the Magiſtrate: as, there is the ſelf ſame diſtance betwene <hi>Athenes and Thebes, vuhich is betuuene Thebes and Athenes:</hi> and if there be a mile, from the top of the hil to the foot, it is as far from the foot, to the top.</p>
            <p>And althowgh, yt abhorring the eyes and eares of al, he is afraid here to affirm it comely, that the lord Maior ſhould preach and miniſter the ſacramentes: yet as a man whoſe

And if he mean by <hi>lawful calling,</hi> the ordinary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling then his anſwer is abſurd. For he falleth into that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, which the Papiſtes doe falsly ſurmiſe: that we giue vnto our Princes power to miniſter the Sacramentes. yea by his diuinitye, which giueth the <hi>chois of the Bishops to the</hi>

            <p>And as this is ſtraunge, in the ſtudy of the lawes of the realm: ſo it is yet more ſtraunge in the practiſe by executing the office of a ciuil Iudg. For tel me, I pray yow, how the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re yow owght to haue of the ciuil cauſes before yow come to iudgment, the tyme to be informed of them on boeth ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, the examining of witneſſes, the conſultation to what law, or to what braunch of the law, the crime should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: tel me (I ſay) how doeth it make yow fitter to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te your miniſtery, then if yow had beſtowed that tyme, in ſtudie of the word of god? if yow ſay, that by the knowlegd of theſe thinges, yow may doe your miniſtery the better: ſo

            <p>As towching that which I ſaid, of <hi>bodily occupations fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto the estate of a Minister, then theſe ciuil offices:</hi> it may appear, for that they are doen withowt pomp or shew, which accompaniyng the ciuil offices, haue bene she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to be vnlawful for the eſtate of a Miniſter. and that glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering shewes and pomp in the Miniſters, are hinderances to their miniſtery, may further appear: by that S.

            <p>Further, when the minde is weried, and that he vnben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, wil giue it reſt for a tyme: it is more apt for him to exerciſe him ſelf, ether in planting or ſetting ſomewhat in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7987:14"/> garden or orchyard by way of recreation, then in shooting as it were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually in yt, in the end to break yt, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke it vnprofitable ether for the ciuil or eccleſiaſtical eſtate. And I meruail what ſteel the edges of their wittes be of, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich wil not be turned, when they cut boeth ſo deep, and in ſo hard matters: whereas it is knowen, that men of counſail haue found in the office of a Iuſtice of peace or Quorum, ſo much to doe, that they haue had ſcarce tyme enowgh, to doe the office of a father of a houshould, in their priuate families. And it muſt take vp ſo much more tyme in the Bishops, then in them: as they, for want of being nourished in the knowledg of the lawes and cuſtomes of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alm, are more vnready in ſuch caſes, then the nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye commonly is: onles they wil ſit vpon the bench li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke idols, nodding rather to the pleaſures of others, then vpon any grounded knowledg, giuing iudgment them ſelues.</p>
            <p>His reaſon of the difference, that <hi>the Miniſter can not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his power to whome he list, but that the Prince may:</hi> is (I fear me) an endeuour of to open flattery, at the leaſt it is to loſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken. For, althowgh there be greater libertie, in the one, then in the other: yet, the Prince can not commit his power to whome <hi>he listeth,</hi> but is bound firſt to chuſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe which fear the lord, then thoſe which are beſt able to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute yt, to the glorie of god and commodity of the ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes: and therefore not the Miniſters, which haue already as much as they can turn them to, when they doe their moſt. Beſide that he can not thus eſcape. For, if the Prince wil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the miniſtery, of the Bishops hand: then his difference falleth to the ground, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by his ſaying, the Prince may wel preach, as the Bishop bear ciuil office.</p>
            <p>As for his example of <hi>Samuel, which did Saules office in slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Agag, when as Saul might not doe Samueles in ſacrifiſing:</hi> it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing for him. For, Samuel did it not by Sauls auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but by an extraordinary calling from god: ſo that if this example proue, that eccleſiaſtical perſons may bear ciuil offices, it proueth that they may doe it withowt any commaundement of the Prince. I pas by, that it was not <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7987:14"/> office to ſacrifice,</hi> as the D. imagineth: he being not of the race of Aharo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to whome onely that apperteyned, but a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">1. Cron. 6. 20. 23.</note> Leuite: ſo that where it is ſaid that he ſacrificed, ether it muſt be vnderſtood that he procured the ſacrifice to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, or els that it was doen by an extraordinary calling, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the rule that the lord had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of offering ſacrifices</p>
            <p>To that I ask, <hi>vuhy if the Miniſter be helped by exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a ciuil office in his ovun perſon, the Magiſtrate should not be helped by exerciſing likevuiſe an eccleſiaſtical:</hi> he anſwereth, <hi>the Magiſtrate may doe by corporal punishment, which the Miniſter ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not doe by eccleſiaſtical:</hi> ſo may the Miniſter doe by ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtic. which the Magiſtrate ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not doe by corporal. And this in deed is the ordinance of god, that euery one should doe that which properly belongeth vnto him: and not that one, should doe al. where he addeth, <hi>that the Magiſtrate may bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the moſt vnrulieſt, where the greateſt cenſures of the church, few now a dayes doe regard:</hi> verely it is no mervail, thowgh they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, being exerciſed as they are, by thoſe to whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteyneth not, and for euery trifling and three halfpenny matter: where if, being duly executed, they be contemned, the Magiſtrate beareth the ſword, to punish that contempt. But the D. would haue the Miniſter, haue that ſword in his hand: that beſide the ſentence of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he might haue alſo the ciuil ſword, wherby he might ſtrike a further<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> fear of him ſelf into the peoples hartes. In deed, thus is fear, which the Apoſtle moſt properly giueth vnto the ciuil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate becauſe of the ſword which he beareth, transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the Miniſters: And thus it commeth to pas, that they hauing boeth ciuil, and eccleſiaſtical vengeance in their handes, make them ſelues more terrible vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then the Magiſtrate him ſelf, which hath but the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil ſword onely. Vuhereby hath growen (and if it be not in tyme preuented) wil grow contempt of Magiſtrates, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inconueniences: wherwith Princes them ſelues hauing bene before beaten, owght ſo much the ſtreighter to look vnto. As for that he bringeth, of other <hi>eccleſiaſtical punishmentes which may be vſed, beſide thoſe preſcribed in the ſcripture:</hi> it appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7987:15"/> to another queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And ſo doeth <hi>Gualters</hi> teſtimony, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich is not onely idly, but shamefully alledged, in this cauſe eſpecially: conſidering that he doeth preciſely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demn the<note place="margin">vpon the 6 chap. 1. Co. Diuiſ. 2. p. 764.</note> exerciſe of any ciuil gouernment in eccleſiaſtical perſons. The two next diuiſions, are anſwered.</p>
            <p>I know that <hi>corporal punishmentes be meanes to bring men to hear.</hi> and (if yow wil alſo) to beleue the word: but that it doeth ſo, or at leaſt ſo much when it is executed by the Miniſter, as when it is executed by the Magiſtrate, I denie: euen as it is in excommunications and eccleſiaſtical cenſures, when they are executed by thoſe to whom they doe not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>It foloweth not, that becauſe <hi>fear of ciuil punishment is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, therefore yt is profitable in the Miniſters hand:</hi> nether for <hi>that it hindereth faith vuhen the Miniſter, preaching in the pulpit, hath the ciuil ſvuord in his</hi> hand, there fore <hi>it hindreth, when the Magiſtrate houldeth it in his hand.</hi> For the profit of the fear of the ſword, dependeth vpon the bleſsing of god, that giueth it efficacy: which bleſsing is then giuen, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen the ſword is drawen by him, vnto whom it properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth.

            <p>That he ſuppoſeth me to affirm, that the cauſes <hi>which</hi>

This onely I gaue to vnderſtand, which I yet affirm, that the ſame cauſes may be boeth ciuil, and eccleſiaſtical. For in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that inquiſition is made, to punish yt with corporal punishment, it is ciuil: the ſame is alſo eccleſiaſtical, when it is examined, to the end that the conſcience may be tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

               <note place="margin">Diuiſ. 7. p. 766.</note> 
               <hi>the Magistrate.</hi> For if the <hi>execution of the lawes belong vnto the Bishop, as the making of them doeth to the Magiſtrate:</hi> it foloweth, that as the one is the proper office of the Magiſtrate, ſo the other is the proper of the Bishop. And further, that in that common wealth, where the Magiſtrate may make the lawes him ſelf alone: there, by his reaſon, the Bishops may execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te them alone. As for his anſwer, it is nothing but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding of that in queſtion.</p>
            <p>That moſes did the <hi>office of the Sacrificer is certain:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diuiſ. 8 pa. 767. &amp; 9. 768.</note> in that he <note n="a" place="margin">Exo. 24. 6. 8.</note> ſprinkled the blood vpon the altar, and people, which perteyned properly vnto the Prieſt. likewiſe the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me is confirmed by his <note n="b" place="margin">Ex. 29. 13.</note> ordeyning of Aharon, and his ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to the prieſthood: which belongeth vnto the Prieſt in like maner.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Moſes (after Aharon was made Prieſt) preſcribed Aharon what he should doe:</hi> he did it from the mouth of the lord, and that alſo as the Prophet of god, and in a <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 7.</note> figure of the doctorship of our ſauior Chriſt, and not ſimply as the ciuil gouernour of the people. For althowgh the ptieshood, were taken from him: yet he remained a Prophet vnto his dying day, and therefore that exception is inſufficient. So is that alſo, of them, in whome he ſaith that <hi>boeth offices ciuil, and eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal met.</hi> For not to enquire how truly thoſe examples are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, eſpecially of <hi>Nehemias,</hi> of whome there is not a ſtep of likelihood, that he <hi>exerciſed boeth the offices:</hi> it helpeth him no whit althowgh it were ſo, as he alledgeth: conſidering that ſuch were extraordinarily raiſed vp of god, and not by any eſtablished order or election of men. Vvhich alſo is a peece of anſwer to that alledged after to this purpoſe of our Sauiour <hi>Chriſtes whipping,</hi> which was in ruinous, and not in<note place="margin">10. Diuiſ. p. 768.</note> ſtanding eſtates of the church.</p>
            <p>Nether is this once to moue, much les to <hi>ouerthow</hi> that which was before diſputed. For the queſtion is, what order the church is bound vnto, not what lawes the lord is bound vnto: likewiſe the queſtion is, not what ether may be doen,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7987:16"/> or tolerated in the deſolation and waſt of the church, but what owght to be doen, in a church eſtablished and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: and what that order is, for eſtablishment wherof, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man muſt employ him ſelf, according to his calling. In <hi>Elies and Samuels tymes,</hi> it appeareth that the church was in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable eſtate: boeth by the whole diſcours of the ſtory, and namely <note n="a" place="margin">1. Sam. 3. 1.</note> that there was a great <hi>dearth of the vuord of god.</hi> But mark (I pray yow) this diuinity, he would haue their examples which haue bene (as he ſaith) <hi>boeth Priestes and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yea and</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">pag. 262.</note> 
               <hi>Captaynes alſo of the host,</hi> ſerue to proue that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>may be Iuſtices of peace,</hi> but not that, <hi>they may be Princes or Cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taines</hi> where as if thoſe examples proue, that a Miniſter may be choſen to bear ciuil office, they proue eſpecially, that he may be choſen to bear that office, which they bare, from w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hom he fetcheth his profe. For if that wherefore they may be choſen to other ciuil offices, doe not agree vnto them: the other which haue their ground from thence can much les agree. Therefore, if the D. be afraid to confes, that thes examples proue, that a Bishop may be a king or a Captain if he be choſen to yt: he owght alſo to be afraid, to confes that a bishop may be a Iuſtice of peace, when he is choſen vnto it.</p>
            <p>To that I ſay, that <hi>theſe examples doe as vuel proue, that the ciuil Magistrate may be a Bishop, as that the Bishop may be a ciuil Magistrate:</hi> he anſwereth, that the <hi>ciuil offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce is accidental to the ministery, and ſuch as may be remoued from it, but the ministery is not ſo vnto Princes, onles they be ordinarily called:</hi> then which, what can be more confuſedly ſpoken. For, if I should graunt, that the Prince might be a Miniſter of the goſpel, and the Miniſter of the goſpel a Prince: why should not (I beſech yow) the miniſtery be as accidental to the princehood, as the princehood vnto the miniſtery. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, if it be not accidental to the princehood, and yet ſuch a thing as agreeth vnto it: it muſt needes be eſſential, that is, that which can not be ſeuered from it, withowt hurt of that eſtate. Beſide that, in placing the difference of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7987:16"/> reſpect of the Miniſtery, to the princehood, and of the princehood to the Miniſtery, in that the Prince may <hi>not be a Minister withowt an ordinary calling:</hi> yow giue to vnderſtand, that the Miniſter may bear ciuil office, withowt an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary calling. For if the Miniſter may not bear ciuil office, vntil he be ordinarily called: then here is yet no diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, betwene the reſpect of a Miniſter to a ciuil offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and the ciuil officer, to the Miniſtery. In the end yow are compelled, to deſtroy your own diſtinction: affirming, <hi>that as a minister may ioyn to his Ministery, a ciuil office, if he be called therevnto by the Prince, ſo the Prince may ioyn to his office the function of the Minister, if he be called vnto it by the Bishop.</hi> For ſo yow muſt needes mean, ſeing yow make him the Stward of eccleſiaſtical officis: which abſurdity before this birth of yours, I ſuppoſe was neuer heard of: and it is thorowgh owt the whole diſcours confuted. For, as for that yow ad, <hi>if they be lawfully called,</hi> it is to open folly: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the queſtion is, whether there be any ſuch election lawful.</p>
            <p>Here the D. is taken again, in his wordes. For if the<note place="margin">Diuiſ. 10. p. 768.</note> example of our Sauiour Chriſtes <hi>whipping, doe proue that, a Minister may medle with ciuil affaires:</hi> then it proueth, that he may not onely ſit in iudgment of crimes, but alſo be the <hi>Tortor himſelf,</hi> which he denieth. For our Sauiour Chriſt, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the punishment with his own hand.</p>
            <p>To that alſo I alledged, that <hi>the Ministers, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Paul and Peter, may be Fishers, and Tentma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, if of the D. examples it may be concluded, that it is lavuful for a Minister to bear ciuil office:</hi> he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>they may doe ſo vpon like occaſion.</hi> The occaſion of S. Paules laboring with his handes was, partly that he<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 12 1. Theſſa. 5.</note> might not in that point be inferior to the fals. Apoſtels, which toke no ſtipend: partly to ſupport the need, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty of the churches. There being now therfore Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, which teach withowt wages and diuers churches which are very poor: by the D. anſwer, it is conuenient the Bishops
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7987:17"/> should exerciſe ſome handycraft. which beſide other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, is againſt that which him ſelf hath truly ſaid, <hi>that they are hinderances vnto the miniſtery:</hi> conſidering that there be no ſuch giftes now a daies as the Apoſtles had, which we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re able to doe more with one hand, then we with boeth. And if his anſwer were trw, yet it is nothing to purpoſe. For, if by theſe examples he wil conclude, that Miniſters may ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be called to the ciuil gouernment: then it muſt alſo fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that by theſe examples of S. Paul and Peter, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may ordinarily haue occupations ioyned with their miniſteries. But if the Miniſters may not exerciſe any han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicraft, but in like caſes as the Apoſtles did, and vpon like callinges: then it foloweth alſo, that they may not exerciſe ciuil offices, but in like time, and vpon like callinges as thoſe did, from whome he draweth his proofes. The reſt is anſwered.</p>
            <p>Before the D. ſaid, that the <hi>Miniſters could not exerciſe any ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diuiſ. 11. p. 769.</note> 
               <hi>iuriſdiction in tyme of perſecution:</hi> here he ſaith, that <hi>Timothy,</hi> w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich<note place="margin">Diuiſ. 7. p. 762.</note> liued in time of perſecution, <hi>exerciſed ciuil iurisdiction.</hi> Thus, like a windshaken reed, he neuer ſtandeth in one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. But (I pray yow) note his reaſon, which is <hi>becauſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made of accuſers and witneſſes:</hi> as if they were not common to al kinde of iudgmentes. For where the thing is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, there the trial muſt needes be ether by confeſsion, or witneſſes: ſo that if there be an eccleſiaſtical iudgment, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re muſt needes be witneſſes and accuſers: otherwiſe the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in tyme of perſecution, should take vpon him ciuil iuriſdiction, withowt the conſent of the Magiſtrate, which is abſurd, and being vrged by me, is vnanſwered. yea the Houſemother, which, vpon accuſation and witnes of ſome of hir children, chaſteneth other ſome: should by the D. ſaying, break vpon the office of the ciuil Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Vpon diuerſe reaſons browght to shew, that S. Peters killing Ananias and Saphyra with the word (which reaſon<note place="margin">Diuiſ. 12. p. 770. Pigg. 5. lib. hierarch. cap. 2.</note> was miniſtred him owt of Pigghius) proueth not that the Miniſters may haue their priſons: he anſwereth nothing, but taking vp the carcaſe of his argument, in ſteed of bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, aſſayeth to blow life into it, after this ſort. <hi>Peter pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7987:17"/> with death, did nothing repugnant to his vocation: therfore it is not repugnant, to the vocation of a Miniſter, to punish with temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment:</hi> which foloweth not. For as muche as the vocation of a Miniſter now, is not the ſame which Peters was at that tyme: not onely for that he was an Apoſtle, but alſo, for that withowt a particular motion of the ſpirit of god, it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for any, or for Peter him ſelf to haue doen ſo.</p>
            <p>That browght to vphould this with, that that <hi>which Peter did by extraordinary power, the Miniſtery now may doe by an ordinary:</hi> is a very cartrope, to pul in al confuſion into the church and common wealth. For thus, of that Phinees a priuate man killed, and the Iſraelites borowed, which they neuer meant to reſtore: if the Magiſtrate wil licence men to doe ſo, it shal be lawful by the D. rule. If he ſay, that thoſe are thinges for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, but not this, that a Miniſter should bear ciuil offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: it is nothing but an asking of that in controuerſie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupon he continually faleth. And where he ſaith, he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the <hi>fact of Peter, and not of the maner:</hi> euen the fact of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was to kil a man, withowt any vnder Miniſter. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this anſwer alſo, it foloweth that the Magiſtrate may appoint the Bishops, to be the Tortors and hangmen: w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich the D. hath before denied. How commeth it alſo to pas, that he which <note n="a" place="margin">pag. 149.</note> before compared the politik lawes of god, putting Idolaters and adulterers to death, in <hi>cruelty with the Turkes lawes:</hi> now maketh it a death matter, if a man, to conceal ſome part of his wealth, being iudicially demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereof, do make a ly.

M. Bezas meaning is onely, that as the lord, when there was no Chriſtian Magiſtrate, did vſe corporal punishmentes, and thoſe of death, againſt them which reſiſted the doctrine of the goſpel: ſo the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, should doe the ſame: ſo that althowgh his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeach be diuers with that I propounded, yet his iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gment is al one.</p>

            <p>The place owt <hi>of his epiſtle</hi> 110, is to as ſmale purpoſe.

            <p>I pray god, that the cuſtome of shameful denials, doe not ſo harden your forhead: that no point of truth how sharp ſoeuer, can perce it. Howbeit I truſt, whatſoeuer yt pleaſe yow to ſay, it is manifeſt to al that doe not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie cloſe their eyes againſt the truth: that <hi>the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

That which yow ad owt <hi>of Deut.</hi> 17, maketh nothing for yow: for, they are there bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to reſort vnto the Prieſt, as to the Interpreter of the law, when the queſtion was difficult, and they knew not what to doe. which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, in that he diſtinguisheth there the Prieſt, from the Iudges: ſo that in ſuch appeales, he placeth the Prieſts and Leuites office, in teaching what is the wil of god, and the Iudgis office in giuing ſentence accordingly: as appeareth yet more plainly in the ſame <note n="a" place="margin">verſ. 11.</note> chapter.</p>
            <p>The ſame is to be anſwered, to that alledged owt of <hi>Nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> 27. In which matter that the Prieſt was preſent, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to conſultation for the difficulty thereof, to know what was the wil of god in that behalf, it is manifeſt, in that he being not able to reſolue of the matter, Moſes <note n="b" place="margin">verſ. 5.</note> was fayn to bring it to the lord: To let pas, that it was not <hi>Aharon which was taken into that conſultation,</hi> but Eleazar: onles yow wil haue <hi>Aharon decide controuerſies,</hi> after his death.</p>
            <p>The example of <hi>Melchiſedec boeth king and Priest,</hi> is more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly alledged, then the other: not onely becauſe he was before the law, when this order of ſeparating the prieſthood<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.

Yow might much better haue alledged Abraham, which was boeth a Prieſt, a Prophet, and a noble warrior: which notwithſtanding, yourſelf doe not permit vnto the Bishop.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>appeal, which Conſtantine graunted, from the ciuil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate vnto the Bishops, likewiſe Theodoſtus and Carolus graunt that men might chuſe the Bishops Iudges of their controuerſies, if either party would:</hi> they were the wreſtes, wherwith the Princes ſcepters were wrung owt of their handes, and (as I haue before she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed owt of M.

Paul.</hi> And in deed by the firſt of theſe decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the Bishops ciuil autoritie, is made equal with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7987:19"/> And by the other, it is at the pleaſure of the peop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, whether al the ciuil Magiſtrates shal be Idoles or no, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the bare name of the Magiſtrate, withowt doeing any duty. For, if ether of the parties, be affected towardes the Bishops iudgment: the Magiſtrates may goe lay them do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wn to sleep. Nether doeth it folow, that becauſe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours gaue ſuch liberty, or licentiouſnes rather, vnto the church, or becauſe ſome Bishops vſed it: that therfore, the <hi>practiſe of the church was ſuch.</hi> For I haue shewed, that the godly Counceles forbad it: and that the godly fathers vtterly misliked of it.

For nether is it ſaid, whether they medled with ciuil affaires before their bishoprik, or in yt: and if it were, conſidering there is no approbation of their doeing, but onely a bare telling that ſuch a thing they did, it can not help him. For it is one thing to ſay, they were commended for dexterity in ſuch matters: and another to ſay, that they did it in dutie, and wel. euen as if the ciuil offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, taking the pulpit, and ſpeaking fitly of a text, a man might giue him the commendation of dexteritie in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the text, and withal, condemn him for doeing it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owt<note place="margin">pag. 341.</note> calling.

And of M.

            <p>Seing therefore the Miniſters office, is onely in thinges that pertayn to god, which for a degree of excellency that they haue in promoting our ſaluation, more then other, the holy goſt oppoſeth vnto the Princes, and common wealth affaires: ſeing alſo it is of greater weight, then the ſtrongeſt bak can bear, of wider compas, then the largeſt handes can faddam: a ſoldiarfare that wil be onely attended vpon: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo it tendeth to the deſtruction of the body, when one membre encrocheth vpon the office of another: and that the ciuil Magiſtrate may by the ſame right invade the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the Miniſter, as he the office of the ciuil Magiſtrate: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further our Sauiour Chriſt, hauing the ſpirit withowt meaſure, refuſed as a thing vnmete for his miniſtery, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Iudg: ſeing alſo the Apoſtles indued with ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious giftes, as are not now to be looked for, gaue ouer the office of the Deaconship, as that which they were not, with

For, if it be but <hi>commonly</hi> ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and not alwaies: then it may be taken otherwiſe in this place. His firſt example likewiſe out of Peter 1. 5. is plain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: for thereby appeareth, that Peter an Apoſtel, and no Bishop, is called Elder. nether is there any word in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7987:21"/> that place, wherby the exhortation to the Elders should not be applied, as wel to the Elders which gouerned onely, as to thoſe which labored in the word alſo: conſidering that the word of <hi>feeding,</hi> reſpecteth not onely preaching, but that gouernment alſo which is with owt preaching: in which reſpect boeth in ſcripture, and otherwiſe, the ciuil Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te is ſaid to feed: And it is to great an ouerſight, to think that becauſe <hi>al Bishops be Elders, therefore al Elders are Bishops:</hi> w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen as the name of Elder is common vnto al, which haue gouernment of the church, and moſt properly agreeth to thoſe, which haue the gouernment onely, withowt further charge of teaching. And the name is taken, of the vſage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law: where they which had onely gouernment ether in church or common wealth, were ſo called.</p>
            <p>Secondly he ſaith, that by thoſe that gouerned, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored not in the word: are <hi>vnderſtanded, thoſe, which miniſtred the ſacramentes.</hi> where to let pas that which hath, and shal be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (god willing) shewed, that the ſame owght to be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the word and Sacramentes: I would know of him, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich hangeth ſo of the interpretation of men, why he hath here departed from the iudgment of the learned and godly writers of our age, and forged an interpretation, which hath no approbation of any auncienty. For, as for that he ſaith of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> beſide that yt is vntrw: if he had neuer ſo ſmale a ſound that way, he would haue rong it ſo deep, that withal he would haue turned Chryſoſtomes clapper. But obſerue, how vnproperly he maketh the Apoſtle to ſpeak, in giuing the name of gouernment vnto that, wherein there is no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment at al. For is yt not (think yow) a ſtrong kinde of gouernment, and needeth it not a great gift of diſcretion and iudgment, to powr a litle water vpon the childes head, diſtribute a lofe of bread, cary the cup, and ſay, or read a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, al, as he is praeſcribed? when the Apoſtle, no where gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this title of gouernment vnto the Deacons, in whom notwithſtanding is required no common diſcretion, to know to whome, and how much is to be giuen: how much les would he giue it to ſuch, as haue the onely, and bare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacramentes.</p>

               <hi>Elders by voices in euery church,</hi> firſt he excepteth, that <hi>the plentith of preachers then was ſuch, that euery congregation where Paul and Barnabas had to doe, might haue moe then one:</hi> w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich is ſaid withowt ether profe, or likelihood. the vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th wherof may eaſely appear, in that to the great cities, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here there was greateſt ſtore: S. Paul was fain to ſend Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy and Titus for ſupplies, which otherwiſe he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld ſo hardly ſpare. Then he ſaith, <hi>to ordeyn Elders throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gh euery church, is to ordein one Pastor in euery one,</hi> which is no pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but a figuratiue ſpeach, and that doubly: boeth in that the general name of Elder, is put for the particular, and in that the plural number is put for the ſingular. Therfore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he can work it owt with good reaſons, to proue that the gouerning Elders, can not here be vnderſtanded: the ſimple and plain ſens, is to be praeferred. As for the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce <hi>of Titus,</hi> it helpeth him not. For the Apoſtel referring Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus to that order, which he had preſcribed him: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth hym ſelf, to purſu the office of the teaching El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, vpon occaſion of fals teachers, which trobled the church.</p>
            <p>For that owt of <hi>Caluin and Brentius,</hi> it may be ſaid, that alt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>howgh S. Luke cal them Elders, which were Bishops: yet he calleth them not ſo onely. And of M. Caluin, it muſt needes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7987:23"/> be ſo vnderſtanded: ſeing he auoucheth the place of Titus,<note place="margin">Inſtit. 4. bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ok 3. chap. ſect. 8.</note> which the An. confeſſeth al one with the 14 actes, for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtablishment of theſe gouerning Elders. But if the D. had read M. Nowels catechiſm, ſo diligently as he would ſeem:<note place="margin">a pag. 155.</note> this would not haue bene ſo ſtraunge to him. For where he sheweth, that the Paſtor owght not to excommunicate wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thowt the iudgment of the church, and declareth that for that purpoſe there were in the wel ordered churches cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyn Seniors choſen, and ioyned with the Paſtor: he quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this very place, which the admonition doeth. And I ſee not why, it may not be as wel referred to the Elders, as to the Bishops: Seing S. Luke there ſetteth forth, how they ſet a ful order in the church. And of that iudgment, is the greek<note place="margin">Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in 14. ctcto.</note> Scholiaſt, which affirmeth that <hi>thoſe vuhich folovued S. Paul and Barnabas, vuere vuorthy to be Bishops:</hi> and that they <hi>created of them Elders and Deacons alſo.</hi> In the next diuiſion, if the D. firſt anſwer be onely conſidered, he might iuſtly complain of me: but when he by and by, reaſoneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the admonition, for that yt <hi>would proue Seniors owt of that place of 14 Actes,</hi> al ſee that I haue doen him no wrong.</p>
            <p>To proue further, that boeth Paſtors, and Elders which<note place="margin">Diuiſ. 5. p. 630.</note> onely gouern, can <hi>not be vnderſtanded in that place of the Actes:</hi> he aſsigneth this reaſon, for <hi>that the holy gost should vſe equiuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or ſpeak dowtfully:</hi> then which, there can be nothing more vnſauery. For it is a great ouerſight, that he can not put a difference, betwene a word that is general, and hath diuers formes vnder yt (of which ſort this word Elder is) and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wene that which hath diuers ſignifications. Rather I may ſay, that for ſo much as S. Luke did not vſe, the particular word of Bishop, but the word Elder, which conteineth bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Bishop, and other Elders: that his meaning was, not that the Bishops onely should be meant. And ſuerly, when as the word Elder, doeth ſo agree to Bishops, that it doeth much more properly (as hath bene shewed) agree to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors: it were hard to vnderſtand Bishops, and shut owt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors, to whom that name doeth moſt properly pertayn: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially there being no circumſtance in that place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7987:23"/> that should be of neceſsity tyed to the Paſtor onely. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that thoſe which haue knowledg in the hebrue tong, know that the ſcripture vſeth ſome tymes <note n="a" place="margin">Iudg. 10. 4 Iudg. 15. 16.</note>

Nether can that owt of M. <hi>Gualter,</hi> maintein any ſuch opinion: ſeing it was not lawful for the church, to appoint any ordinary Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, <hi>to hear ciuil cauſes:</hi> nether needed any ether goe to them for iudgment, or ſtand vnto the iudgment giuen, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the parties liſted, therfore that could not be any gouernment, which was withowt autority. How true it is, that <hi>learned men expound the word gouernmentes, of ciuil and eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical,</hi> at the leaſt to the D. knowledg: the reader may therby know, that Gualter which he choſe to ſpeak for them al, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not affirm it. For in that he ſaith, <hi>there is now no need of them ſeing there is a Chriſtian Magiſtrate:</hi> he manifeſtly oppoſeth them to a Chriſtian Magiſtrate. Althowgh M. <hi>Gualters</hi> autority, may not be receiued in this queſtion of diſcipline. For beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de that his hand, is herein againſt the learned boeth ould, and nue which I haue ether red or heard of, alſo againſt the practiſe approued in the churches of al ages, and amongeſt them againſt the practiſe alſo, vſed in ours: it shal appear, that the reaſons drawen from him, are altogither inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>
            <p>Then he ſaith, that <hi>by that word Gouernours, the Pastors may be vnderſtanded, becauſe hauing ſpoken of the Doctor before, he mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not the Paſtor:</hi> which is abſurd, boeth becauſe it should be a meruailous confuſion, to haue caried the Paſtor ſo far from his fellowes, which are the Miniſters of the word, and reckened vp in the beginning: and for that, the Paſtor is not ſeuered from the Doctor in gouerning, but onely in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7987:24"/> kinde of teaching. whereas he, by his anſwer, shutteth owt the Doctor from the gouernment of the church. Beſide that howſoeuer I doe <hi>make a Pastor, and a Doctor, diuers:</hi> yet for as much as him ſelf, maketh <hi>them al one,</hi> S. Paul placing the Doctor before, he owght to haue bene ashamed to ſay <hi>that S. Paul may mean this of the Paſtor.</hi> That he addeth, <hi>that the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce being doutful, it can not ſerue to eſtablish the Seniors, is</hi> daungerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken, and ſmelleth of popery: as if the ſcripture should loſe her autority, becauſe men agree not of the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it. Althowgh (I ſuppoſe) there are few places of ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, wherein thinges are ſpoken of, ſo shortly: that haue ſo ful conſent of learned interpreters of our tyme, as this place hath, for that ſignification of Seniors, which we vſe it for. And in deed, when the Apoſtle maketh it a diſtinct offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, from the Miniſters of the word, which notwithſtanding haue the gouernment of the church: it muſt needes be an office occupied in gouernment alone, otherwiſe it should not be ſeuered, from their office.</p>
            <p>The ſame reaſon, is of the place to the Romanes: aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> which, that which the D. bringeth owt <hi>of Caluin,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth. For althowgh the precept of <hi>bearing rule in diligence,</hi> may by proportion, be caried to al <hi>Magistrates,</hi> yea and to al craftes men, ouer their Apprentiſes: yet the wordes of the Apoſtle, are neuertheles vnderſtood pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of the Elders in queſtion, as M.

            </p>
            <p>Yf <hi>they preached ſome tyme,</hi> that was not by vertw of this office: and the place <hi>of Timothy</hi> alledged <hi>of</hi> M <hi>Beza,</hi> doeth not proue it.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7987:24"/> not as M. Beza, for a kinde of Elder, differing boeth from the Paſtor, and Doctor. But the An. is like that fellow that wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uld haue boeth his eies put owt, that his neigbour might le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe one.

            </p>
            <p>Here the An. repenteth him of his good deedes.

            <p>Howbeit for the readers ſake, althowgh this Eldership is manifeſt in it ſelf, of the wordes of the holy ſcripture: yet the ſame shal receiue ſome confirmation of the practiſe of the churches after, which kept this order boeth in perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and peace. This I wil doe, if I firſt in a word, note how this order of Eldership, was taken from the gouernment of the people of god, before and vnder the law. yt is therfore to be obſerued, that ſo ſone as there is made mention, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fixed form of church, which ſtanding of diuers housho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uldes, were deuided into particular aſſemblies: ſo ſoon is made mention, of this office of Elders. For Moſes to let the<note place="margin">Exo. 4. 29.</note> churches, and aſſemblies of the Iſraelites to vnderſtand hys Embaſſage from god: aſſembled the Elders. which, that they were eccleſiaſtical officers, thereby may appear: for that vnder ſuch a Tyrant, and ſuch oppreſsion as the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites were in, it is altogither vnlike, that they had the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of Magiſtrates of their own. And if a man would ſay, that thoſe Elders were the Taskmaſters, which Pharao had ſet ouer the Iſraelites: beſide diuers vnlikelihoodes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is flatly confuted, in that after the Iſraelites departure owt of Aegypt, before any nue creation of officers, this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Elders is ſpoken of, and as church officers, <note n="a" place="margin">Exo. 17. 5.</note> taken to the adminiſtration of church matters.</p>
            <p>Another example hereof is, <note n="b" place="margin">2.

And howſoeuer Poſsidonius, alow of Valerius fact: yet boeth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of that order by the ſpace of 400 yeares, and the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of other Bishops round abowt, is withowt compariſon of more weight: eſpecially, when it appeareth by Poſsidonius writinges, that (being a good ſimple man) he was nether of great learning, nor deep iudgment. where alſo, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that as the diſcipline was beſt kept in thoſe churches of Afrik: ſo the doctrine remayned pureſt in them: As may appear not onely by the Councels of Carthage, compared with other councels of that tyme, but alſo by Auguſtins wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, compared with Ieromes, and other Doctors boeth greek and latin, in the ſame age.</p>
            <p>In other churches, where this diſcipline was not ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently looked vnto: there are notwithſtanding mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7987:26"/> wherby we may know, that they went owt of the way. As at Alexandria, where, althowgh the Elders did teach: yet after Arrius was convicted of hereſie, it was decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>that the Elders should no more teach.</hi> by which<note place="margin">Socrat. 5. booK chap. 22.</note> decree, they did, as it were, couertly confes: that they had receiued the reward of breaking the order of god, in permitting that the Elder, should teache in the church. For if it had bene of the inſtitution of an Elder, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach: Nether Arrius, nor ten thowſand moe ſuche heretik Elders, owght to haue giuen cauſe of ſuch a decree: ſeing the inſtitution of the lord owght not to be broken, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abuſe of men.

            <p>Now, if the Elders had no right to preach &amp;c. by reaſon of their office, or as incident into yt, if the Bishop onely had right, and the other but by indulgence, or commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: thus far we haue boeth Tertul. and Ierome agreeing with vs, that by the word of god and his inſtitution, the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath not to doe with the word and Sacramentes. And the ſame autors we haue alſo, flatly contrary to the D.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7987:27"/> which houldeth (as appeareth by the diſcours of his book) that al <hi>Elders and Deacons of the church, althowgh not in gouernment, yet towching the miniſtery of the word and ſacramentes, are equal, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue as much autority, as the Bishop him ſelf.</hi> This difference onely remaineth, betwene Ierome and vs, whether this being not of gods inſtitution, that an Elder may preach, or Miniſter the ſacramentes: it be lawful for any man, to giue licence therof. which bouldnes of remouing and changing the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undes, which the lord, in the tarriers of his word hath limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: boeth is before, and shal afterward (god willing) be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther handled.</p>
            <p>Laſt of al, for proof of theſe church Elders, which being occupied in the gouernment, had nothing to doe with the word: the teſtimonie of Ambroſe alledged in my former book, is ſo clear and open, that he which doeth not giue place vnto yt, muſt needes be thowght as a bat, or an owl, or ſome other night bird, to delight in darknes. His ſaying is, that the <hi>Elders fel avuay by the ambition of the Doctors:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ambroſ. in 2. Timot. 5.</note> where by oppoſing the <hi>Elders to Doctors,</hi> which tawght, he plainely declareth that they had not to doe with the word. whervpon it is manifeſt, that boeth yt was the vſe in the beſt reformed churches, certein hundreth yeares after the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the Apoſtles, to haue an Eldership which medled not with the word, nor adminiſtration of Sacramentes: and that they which wanted it, partly complayned of the want, partly declining from this inſtitution of god, corrected their error, at the leaſt, they kept this difference, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas the Bishop preached and miniſtred the Sacramentes, in right of his office: the Elder did it not as a thing inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his office, but onely vpon indulgence of the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop.</p>
            <p>Another point wherin the D. turneth his tong is, that where he confeſſed before, that there <hi>was in euery church Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors:</hi> now he ſaith, <hi>in ſome onely.</hi> And to ſalue this contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with him ſelf: he ſaith <hi>by euery church, he ment, euery cheif city.</hi> Thus yow ſpeak, but by what rule, and according to whoſe language, when yow expound <hi>euery church, euery cheif citie?</hi> as if
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7987:27"/> their were no churches, but in cheif cityes. But thus muſt al their tonges be deuided, which put them forth againſt the truth. Howbeit to come to that point, by what reaſon can yow ſhew, that the Apoſtles inſtituted a ſeueral Miniſtery for cheif cities, which they did not for vplandish townes? what were this, but to bring in an inequality, amongeſt the churches: which your ſelf otherwhere, confes owght not to be. Yt is (I graunt) meet for the furtherance of the goſpel, that the cheifeſt cityes, when al can not be ſerued, should haue the firſt, the ſufficienteſt, and (according to their need) the greater numbre: but, that they should haue a ſeueral Miniſtery ordeyned for them, into the felowship whereof, the ſmaler churches may not be admitted, is withowt reaſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the goſpel which conteyneth the doctrine and diſcipline, went not owt of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, into the <hi>cheif cityes onely:</hi> but into al the world. Thirdly, it hath bene shewed, that the epiſtle of S. Paul to Timothy, wherein mention is made of the interteinment of theſe Elders: was not a rule preſcribed to churches in great cities onely, but vnto al churches whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſoeuer. Further, ſeing the Elders are continually ioyned, with the Bishop: it being <note n="a" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part. p. 514.</note> shewed, that the lord ordeyned for euery congregation a Bishop, it muſt folow, that he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned for euery congregation Elders. finally, for as much as the Apoſtles labored, to bring the churches one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to an vniformity, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſmaleſt ceremonies: how can they be thowght, to haue made ſo vneuen work, in the Miniſtery of the church.</p>
            <p>I let pas here the place in the Actes, before handled: w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here<note place="margin">Act. 14.</note> it is ſaid, that Elders <hi>vuere ordeyned in euery church.</hi> Likewiſe, the neceſsity of them, aſwel in other churches, as in churches in the citie: which is after to be handled.

This difference verely, riſeth not in the breadth of shoulders, wherby they are able to cary al this, and the Elders none: but vpon the widenes of the throat, which as the graue, is neuer filled.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is to be obſerued, that the D. which for his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wn profit, ſtretcheth the power of the Prince beyond al bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undes: here, as yf he had to doe with a cheuerel ſcepter, dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth it in.

            <p>To that I alledged of the neceſsity of the Eldership, <hi>becauſe the Paſtor can not haue his ey, in euery corner of his parish &amp;c. he anſwereth, an able Pastor, is able to doe al required of a Paſtor,</hi> which is no anſwer at al.

And now that he vnderſtandeth, that this reaſon is confirmed by M. Peter Martyr: I truſt hereafter, he wil giue it ſome honeſter name, then <hi>my fancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To that I alledged, that <hi>if the Auncientes should not be vnder a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, yt vuould folovu that the lord should haue les care of his church vnder a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, then vnder an vnchriſtian Magistrate:</hi> he anſwereth, that the <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrate is in place of the Eldership,</hi> but nether addeth reaſon him ſelf, nor once towcheth the reaſon which I browght, namely <hi>that yt vuas neuer lavuful for the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch in perſecution, to appoint any that should enter vpon any part of the ciuil Magistrates office.</hi> This alſo could not be a ſufficient recompence, in matters pertayning to the ſoul health, that for an Eldership in euery church, they should receiue one Prince in a whole countrey. For one Prince, can not in the ſpiritual gouernment of the realm bring that to pas, which the Eldership in euery church did before: althowgh he should doe nothing, but attend vpon
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7987:30"/> that. So that to make the Magiſtrates to ſuccede into the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Elders, and therein to doe al the duties appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the Eldership in tymes paſt: is to charge the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates with a thing vnpoſsible, and ſuch as muſt needes kyl their conſciences.</p>
            <p>Thus, where the Chriſtian magiſtrate is giuen of god, to kepe the order which god hath ſet in his church: yow bring him in as a breaker and changer of the order, which god ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th appointed by his holy Apoſtles. But the godly Chriſtian Magiſtrates may vnderſtand, that as nether our Sauior Ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, nor any wiſe and wel inſtructed myniſtery vnder him, wil meddle with any order or form of common wealth law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inſtituted of them, for the better gouernment of their people, but leau them as they finde them: So they owght to leau whole and vntowched, that order which Chriſt hath placed in his church. And as the An. ſaith truly otherwhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, that <hi>Christ came not to ouerthrow ciuil gouernmentes:</hi> euen ſo it is<note place="margin">p. 647.</note> as true, that god ſendeth not kinges to ouerthrow church gouernment, planted by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Yea ſo much more abſurd is this later, then the firſt: by how much they owght to haue more firmity, which were ſet by the lord him ſelf, then which were by men. For what ſon of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam shal preſume to alter that order, which <hi>the lord</hi> hym ſelf from heauen <hi>hath ſet,</hi> And euen ſo doeth the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le preciſely ſpeak of this office with others, that <note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 28.</note> 
               <hi>god ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th ſet it in the church.</hi> Yf it be ſaid, that he ſet alſo Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes and workers of miracles, which are now no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re: it is true, they are now no more, but why are they not? Ys it, becauſe any man hath remoued them? no verely, but becauſe the lord him ſelf, hath withdrawen them. For if the lord had giuen euen vnto theſe dayes, theſe gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of healing and working of miracles &amp;c. I think the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is no man ſo extremely impudent, that would ſay, th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the ciuile Magiſtrate might abolish or put them down. Beſide that, it is vntrue which he ſaith <note n="b" place="margin">p. 659.</note> otherwhere, that <hi>this office is placed amongest thoſe, which be temporal:</hi> for euen th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7987:30"/> next before yt, noteth the office of the Deacon, which is perpetual.</p>
            <p>As for that he crieth owt and ſo oft repeateth, that, by this meanes, <hi>no more is giuen to the Christian Magistrate, then to the Turk,</hi> proceedeth onely of a famyn of reaſons to anſwer, which driueth him to this vnrulynes: otherwiſe, he can not tel how the eſtablishment of this office, should ſpoil the<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 13.</note> Prince of her autority. S. Paul profeſſeth of him ſelf, that he <hi>vurote the ſame, that men red,</hi> that is to ſay ſyncere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not pretending one thing and meaning another: but al this ialouſy, pretended for the Prince againſt the Elders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip, is in deed for the Bishop. So that, albeit the name of the Magiſtrate be houlden owt, to draw this cauſe into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: yet the truth is, that yt is to eſtablish their own tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For as towching autority or preheminence, there is nothing giuen, to be doen by the Eldership ioyntly with the Paſtor, in one onely congregation: al which, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to, the Bishop him ſelf alone, doeth not vndertake to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xecute in a whole dioceſe or prouince. Therfore, if the exerciſe of this ſpiritual iuriſdiction in the Eldership, ſpoil the Magiſtrate of his autority: then the Bishops, are the ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ief in this robbery.</p>
            <p>Vuhere he asketh, <hi>how I shew owt of the ſcripture, that thoſe are the duties of the Elders, which I haue aſsigned.</hi> I anſwer, that foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as S. Paul appointeth them gouernours of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch, togither with the teaching gouernours, placing the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17</note> onely in teaching, and conſequently in publik prayer and adminiſtration of ſacramentes, which are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with yt, or comprehended vnder yt: that therfore, the reſt, remain commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwene them, to be doen as wel of th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſe, as of them.</p>
            <p>That the place of S. Mathew, is not to be vnderſtanded<note place="margin">Diuiſ. 4. p. 636. Math. 18.</note> 
               <hi>onely of priuate offences:</hi> I haue <note n="a" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part. p 66.</note> before declared. your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of <hi>tel the church,</hi> that is <hi>publikly reproue thoſe w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich, admonished priuately, repent not:</hi> is euil nurtured, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in withowt leau. where mark (good reader) how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy it is for the D. to write anſwers, which being preſſed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7987:31"/> giueth him ſelf this liberty: that hauing no key to open the dore, breaketh it open after this ſort. To interpret <hi>tel</hi> by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue,</hi> might haue ſome colour, by that the general is ſome tyme put for the ſpecial: but that <hi>tel the church,</hi> should be, <hi>reproue the offender,</hi> hath a diſeaſe, that al the tropes and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res which I haue red of, are not able to cure. And me thinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that yow which accuſe others for <hi>making the ſcripture a noſe of wax:</hi> if yow wil not put of your shoes, at the leaſt yow sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld wipe them a litle cleaner, when yow enter into the lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ds Sanctuary. That which foloweth, is not a whit better.</p>
            <p>For, after he ſaith that, <hi>by the church may be ment one onely, ſo that he be in autority:</hi> which is not vnlike vnto that, which the papiſtes ſay, that a man may appeal from the Councel, vnto<note place="margin">Concil. To<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 4. Baſilien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f. concil.</note> the Pope. wherof, ſome of the papiſtes them ſelues (if he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e not repent) shal ſit in iudgment: which leauing vnto the Pope the higheſt place in the church, haue notwithſtanding vpon this place, preferred the iudgment of the Councel, to the Popes. But where I require ſome example of this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous ſpeach, <hi>vuherby one is ſaid to be many, one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre a body, one alone a company:</hi> the D. is domb. where I shew further, <hi>that if one onely should be vnderstood by the church, that then the going from thre to one, should not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe but fal, not goe forvuard but bakvuard:</hi> he anſwereth, that to <hi>tel one which hath autority to correct the faut, is more then to tel twenty:</hi> as thowgh the complaint is made, to the end he should be corrected, and not that he should be admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For as for correction, other then by wordes, it owght not to be awarded, onles he refuſe to hear the church: ſo that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſtil the proces is, from the admonition which is by many, to that which is by one. And if the Paſtor be he, that doeth firſt priuately admonish him, and afterward take two moe: by his anſwer, the Paſtor muſt from his own admonition in the preſence of one or two moe, take the matter to him ſelf, and admonish him ſelf alone.</p>
            <p>He hauing thus dalied with the holy ſcripture, after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7987:31"/> that by the word <hi>church, are vnderſtood many: but thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wt of Chryſoſtome are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Prelates and Preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes:</hi> as thowgh S. Paul, did not alſo cal theſe Elders <hi>Preſidentes,</hi> which is al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17</note> with Prelates. Then he addeth, that the place <hi>is vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the gouernment vnder the law, not of any rule which our Sauior Chriſt gaue, to gouern his church vnder the goſpel: euen as where our S. Christ biddeth, to leau the gift before the Altar:</hi> which ouerthroweth his other interpretation. And again <hi>owt of Muſculus,</hi> that it <hi>was but vnto the tyme of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate:</hi> which ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alſo this next before. But if this be ether the law gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nment, or the goſpel gouernment onely, vntil the tyme of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate: then to admonish priuately him that offendeth, to take one or two, if he reſt not in the admo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nition, be alſo of the ſame ſort. For our Sauior Chriſt put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them alike general, alike neceſſary, of like limitation of tyme: for he chayneth them one with another, by the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>k of his commandement, that if this way profit not, then the ſecond muſt folow, and the third after that.</p>
            <p>Then alſo it foloweth, that the meanes to bring ſynners to repentance, ſerued onely for the tyme of the law, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Magiſtrates. For after that our Sau. Chriſt, had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wght how the lord deliteth in the return of the ſynner, and in the fyneding of the loſt shepe: he propoundeth this, as a principal mean, wherby he wil haue that browght to pas. But, let the D. shew, any light owt of the word of god, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby it may appear, that certeyn of theſe commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes are temporal, and certeyn perpetual, certeyn to ſerue for the tyme of the law, and an vnchriſtian Magiſtrate: if not, then the commandement of Chriſt remaineth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rof nether he, nor none other can shew any countermande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſide that it is abſurd, that it should be here decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what order was vſed vnder the law, and not vnder the goſpel: when our Sav. Chriſt inſtructeth his Apoſtles, how to behaue them ſelues in the church, and ſpeaketh of the<note place="margin">

               </note> order, that should be in hys church, in tyme to come.</p>
            <p>That alſo which he citeth owt of <hi>mathews,</hi> is flat againſt hym. For, althowgh our Sau. Chriſt vſeth maner of ſpeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7987:32"/> drawen from the ſeruice of god, which, then in vſe, be not ſo now: yet the commandement he there giueth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that kinde of ſpeach, is perpetual. And as, what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is abrogated of that precept <hi>Mathew</hi> 5, is abrogated by the preſcript word of god, which teacheth vs, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring of calues vpon the altar, and other ceremonial lawes are doen away: So, if he wil haue this ordinance of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d abrogated, he muſt shew vs ſome place of Scripture, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re our Sau.

            <p>After, he ſaith that <hi>thoſe wordes can not be extended, vnto al the preceptes,</hi> firſt becauſe <hi>the office of widowes should be then neceſſary:</hi> But he doeth not conſider, that S. Paul ordeyneth them not ſimply, but vpon condition. yf he had inſtituted the Elders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip with condition, if he had ordeyned that office, rather for the mayntenance of the perſons them ſelues, then for the ſeruice of the church, if he had left ſo ſmal choiſe of th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſe to this office, as to that, namely that none might be ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſen but poor, none but deſtitute of al friendes, none vnder the age of lx yeares: then he had ſaid ſomewhat.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Then he ſaith, <hi>that ſo, Miniſters which haue ſuch infirmities as Timothe, should of neceſsite drink wyne.</hi> By wine, the Apoſtle mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,

            <p>Laſt of al, he bringeth <hi>Chryſoſtome and Caluin,</hi> which refer thoſe wordes vnto Timothes office: which is to no purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. For Timothe for his part (and in his place the Miniſter of the word) had to doe in al thoſe offices, as wel to ordeyn, as to reprehend and punish them, if they did not their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: ſo that, in commaunding Timothe to execute his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, according to the tenure of that Epiſtle, he doeth playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly command the mayntenance of this office. whether the word, <hi>vuithovut ſpot,</hi> be referred vnto <hi>Timothe,</hi> or vnto the <hi>commandement,</hi> I leaue to the readers iudgment: So I doe the next diuiſion. In the next alſo, beſide <hi>Muſculus and Gualters</hi> iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dgment, there is nothing ſauing an extreme, ether forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, or that which is wors: in ſaying that <hi>he remembreth not to haue red any autor, that maketh mention of this Eldership.</hi> For if he had neuer red the autors them ſelues: yet he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld hardly forget that owt of them: which <note n="a" place="margin">In the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>oK.</note> I alledged to th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at purpoſe.</p>
            <p>To the firſt reaſon, prouing that an <hi>Eldership is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diuiſ. 8. p. 640.</note> 
               <hi>needful novu, then in the Apostles tymes, for that the Pastors novu are not of that ſufficiency to gouern al alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, as they vuere then:</hi> he anſwereth, that <hi>there be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſo ſufficient men to make an Eldership now, as there were then:</hi> w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich ſerueth, aſwel to proue that we should haue no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors at al, as that there should be no Eldership, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Paſtor. But how abſurd is it, that becauſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7987:33"/> they can not giue ſo ful and plentiful aſsiſtance now, as the Elders in tymes paſt, therfore they muſt giue no aſiſtance at al. So that oneles he wil ſay, that none of the parish can doe any thing in the gouernment of the church, but the Paſtor alone: he muſt needes confes, that, that wchich may be, ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght to be for ſupport of the Paſtor. his other anſwer, is <note n="a" place="margin">In this ch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ap. diuiſ. 2. &amp; 3.

            <p>Secondly yt was alledged, that <hi>S.

For ſeing, the pouerty of the churches could not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mpt them from this charge, when they were much poorer<note place="margin">

                  </gap>. <hi>Tim. 5.</hi>
               </note>, as appeareth by S. Paul, ſeing alſo yt may be now withowt the charge of the church, as appeareth by the practiſe of the churches, which are ſo gouerned in theſe dayes, where there is not a penny alowed to any Elder: ether he owght to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this, or blush to ſet down that for anſwer: yet he is not afraid <note n="b" place="margin">pag 657.</note> after to put yt, for a <hi>reaſon against the Eldership.</hi> whervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to may be added, that the churches in perſecution, nether thoſe now, nor other in tymes paſt, could haue ſuch helpes of howſes or landes, appropriated to the fineding of their miniſtery, as the churches with vs: but were driuen to pay for al of their own purs. And not that onely, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtreyned to pay their tythes, or other exactions, to the Idolatrous pr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſthood, of that place where they abode: which we are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Diuiſ. 10. p. 641.</note> from, vnder a Chriſtian Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>To the third reaſon, <hi>that the declyning of a popular ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7987:33"/> or that of the best, hath not ſo eaſy redres vnder a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as vnder a Chriſtian magiſtrate:</hi> he ſaith, <hi>men in perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution are not deſirous of honor &amp;c.</hi> which (in a maner) is as much to ſay, as men in perſecution, ceas to be men, and is vntrue, as appeareth boeth in the <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 1. 17. Phili. 2. 21. Ioh. 3. 9.</note> Apoſtles tymes, and after, as I haue <note n="b" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part of this booK p. 500.</note> shewed. Secondly, he anſwereth, <hi>that the gouernours the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were but during the pleaſure of ſuch as ppointed them,</hi> wherof he bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ngeth no profe at al, and is likewiſe vntrue, conſidering, th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at they were choſen to remayn ſo long in their office as they behaued them ſelues vnblamably: or at the leaſt, vntil a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyn term, before which they could not by any equity, but vpon their faut, or their own deſire, be put owt. In the firſt of which two caſes, they are ſomewhere now, as they were then and in the later, they may if it ſeme expedient, euen now, as wel as then: ſo that here is no difference at al, betwene tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and theſe tymes. Nether doeth he conſider, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, being corrupt, the greateſt part of the church, is commonly led away with them: In which caſe, the church is withowt remedy vnder perſecution, when notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding she hath an eaſy remedy, vnder a Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
            <p>Thirdly he ſaith, that, <hi>this graunted, the argument foloweth not:</hi> reaſon he sheweth none, but open askinges of that in queſtion. And whether it folow wel, that <hi>for ſo much as the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ys les inconuenience, in the gouernment of the Elders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip vnder a Chriſtian magistrate, then vnder a Tyrant: therfore it may be better vnder hym, then vnder a Tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> let al the world iudg. his owtcourſes, as alſo his open vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th, that I <hi>confes the church gouernment to be a monarchy,</hi> I pas by: I onely ſaid, that it is a monarchy, in reſpect of our Sau.

               <hi>may be in a Cytie, but not in a Realm,</hi> I alledged, <hi>that it hath had place, by his ovun confeſſion, in a vuhole Realm:</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that that is true, where euery church is, as yt were, within</hi> yt ſelf <hi>a common wealth, as in Fraunce and other perſecuted churches.</hi> wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erein he doeth shameful iniury, to al thoſe churches of god, and to the Apoſtles them ſelues which vſed that order: in aſcribing vnto them, as thowgh they made new common wealthes, or liued not vnder the ſame form of ciuil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, were not obedient vnto the ſame ciuil lawes, and to the ſame Magiſtrates, which the Idolatres them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues were. what one, ether action, or property can yow aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gn in an Eldership, vnder a kingdome, which should cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe this rent: that <hi>there should be ſo many common wealthes, and ſo many kingdomes, as there are Elderships?</hi> why alſo doeth this El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership make a greater rent, in a monarchy where one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth: then in a common wealth, where many gouern. If yow think therfore, becauſe a monarchy is greater, then a common wealth, wherby there muſt be moe Elders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hips in the one, then in the other: beſide that the argument is nawght, that alſo wherevpon it is grounded, is vntrue. For, there are common wealthes, where many rule, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the monarchies, where one onely gouerneth: as Rome in tymes paſt, Venys within our remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Vuhere I alledged alſo, that, <hi>by his reaſon, a monarchy should not be good in the common vuealth, becauſe the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7987:34"/> gouernment of one is good in a hovuſhould, &amp;c.</hi> He anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wereth, that the <hi>autority of the Master of the howshould, deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not from the Princes, but the Eldership doeth:</hi> which is his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed beggery. where, in deed, the autority of a Maſter of a howshould, approcheth nerer vnto the kinde of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Magiſtrate, as that which hath, corporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment annexed vnto yt: then the autority of the Elders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip, which meddleth not that way.</p>
            <p>And becauſe I am entred into that example, I would know of hym, which wil <hi>haue other gouernmentes, fashioned to the form of gouernment of the common wealth:</hi> whether in a common wealth, where many haue equal autority, the magiſtrate may ordeyn, that the father of the houshould, shal not ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le his own hows alone, or be cheif in yt, but shal haue his wife of like autority, or ſome of his ſeruantes quarter Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. If he be ashamed of this, then he ſeeth that the wal of al his defence, againſt the diſcipline of the church, aſwel in this cauſe, as in diuers other, pauncheth: ſo that it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to abide, the <hi>vueight of a fox.</hi> For thus, there is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely (as he obiecteth) a <hi>ſeueral gouernment in euery Town:</hi> but in euery priuat hows. And if the Maſter of the houshould may, and owght to retein his autority withowt preiudice of the Magiſtrate: why may it not be ſo, in the gouernment of the church.</p>
            <p>Vuhat wil he further ſay, to the Scholemaſter, which he otherwhere affirmeth to be an <hi>Eccleſiastical officer:</hi> may there not be, ether two in one Schole, vnder a Prince, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in one Schole vnder a common wealth where many ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue like autority, oneles the common wealth be therby man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, and the magiſtrates autority empaired? But of th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is matter, I haue alſo ſpoken <note n="a" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part of this booK. pag. 604.</note> otherwhere. Howbeit, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereas the D. alowing of this Eldership in a common we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alth, can not abide it in a monarchy: I wil ſay this further, that if there were any daunger to a common wealth, by this Eldership, it should be greater to the ſmale common wealthes, then to great monarchies: conſidering that they,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7987:35"/> should not be able, ſo wel to repres the Eldership ouerrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and goeing beyond their bowndes. And if the Elders hips autority, belong vnto the magiſtrate (as he ſaith): then by how much, theſe magiſtrates haue les power, and fewer prerogatiues ouer their peoples, then the monarches ouer their ſubiectes, by ſo much haue they more need, then the other, to kepe al in their own hand.</p>
            <p>Vpon his own confeſsion, that <hi>there be more diſordered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diuiſ. 13. p. 643.</note> 
               <hi>now, then in tyme of perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> I concluded <hi>that there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo much more aſiſtance, for the Pastor to finde them ovut, to iudg of the quality of the faut,</hi> and to correct them with cenſures of the church. Herevnto he anſwereth, that it is <hi>better doen by the Magiſtrate, and by corporal punishment:</hi> which is <note n="a" place="margin">diuiſ. 2. an 3. of th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is chapter.</note> before anſwered, althowgh yt be vnworthy anſwer, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that albeit the bodily punishment, were more apt to reform thinges amis: yet thereof foloweth not, but that boeth the ciuil punishment, and eccleſiaſtical togither, wil doe more then the ciuil punishment alone.</p>
            <p>I would alſo know, why the Paſtor owght not, to cary, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen priuate offences great or ſmale, vnto the Magiſtrate: if it be ſo, that this eccleſiaſtical autority, be eſcheted to him. As for that he alledgeth owt of Gualter, that <hi>men wil not ſet a ſtraw by the autority of the Eldership:</hi> it ſerueth aſwel againſt the eccleſiaſtical cenſures of al Paſtors, and of our Bishops, as againſt the Elders: and more againſt them, then againſt th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſe. For ſomuch as, if they <hi>ſet not a ſtraw</hi> by the Elders and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor togither iointly, they wil much les eſteme the Paſtors or Bishops alone. And if they ſet nothing by it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced by the ciuil magiſtrate: they wil much more ſet th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em at nawght in perſecution, when for the contempt of yt, there is not onely no corporal punishment, but a reward at the handes of the Tyrants. The bare names of ſuſpenſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ns and excommunications, ſtrike a fear into the heartes of the people: whych notwithſtanding (throwgh an horrible abuſe of them, for euery trifling money matter) are not to be feared: according to the <note n="b" place="margin">prou. 26. 2.</note> wiſe mans ſaying, <hi>acauſeles cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rs,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7987:35"/> shal not come, but flyeth avuay as the sparovu or ſvua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seing then thes fray bugges, no more to be eſtemed, as towching the conſcience, or further then they empty the purs, then the braying of an Aſſe, ſtrike ſuche a fear: with w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat power, would the lord accompany them, when they be executed according to his inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. for further anſwer, the<note place="margin">libr. de cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anim.</note> reader may haue recours vnto M.

And this voice tendeth, aſwel to the ſubuerſion of al eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cenſures, for euer hereafter: as to the vtter condemning of that, which was vſed by the Apoſtles heretofore.</p>
            <p>Althowgh, if it be the ordinance of god, this is no reaſon againſt yt: conſidering that the owtrage of men, can not put the lord to ſilence, or make his ordinance to giue place. In the next, where, vpon his anſwer, I conclude, <hi>that ether vue muſt haue no Pastor at al (vuhich is abſurd,) or els an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership in as many places, as ſufficient men may be gotten:</hi> he anſwereth nothing, beſide repetitions, and demaundes of that in queſtion.</p>
            <p>In the next, where is proued that <hi>the hardnes or appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant impoſsibility may not be conſidered, vuhen there is a commandement to doe any thing:</hi> he letteth al that defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce goe to the ground, wherein notwithſtanding he placed great force. Let him therfore ſtrike owt that obiection, or if he moue further debate herein, let him not be ashamed, to return bak, and take his work before hym. And for furth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er anſwer thereunto, let hym loke <note n="a" place="margin">li. de cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anim.</note> M.

Althowgh it <note n="b" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part. p. 156.</note> hath bene shewed, that the example of the Apoſtles, and general practiſe of the churches vnder their gouernment: euen withowt a commandement, drawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th a neceſsity.</p>
            <p>Then he ſaith, that <hi>if it were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it were but a temporal comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7987:36"/> as the widowes, the eating of blud, and washing of feet.</hi> Of the widowes, hath bene anſwered, the decree of the <hi>blud,</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a ſimple prohibition, after our Sau. Chriſt (whoſe blud that did <note n="a" place="margin">

So that euen then, when that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was made, the faithful, boeth of the Iues or Gentiles, might haue eat yt: ſo they did yt withowt offence of thoſe which were weak. And if there were now any Iue weak in faith, whom we should by eating of blud, driue from the goſpel: I dowt not, but that vntil he be fully inſtructed of the liberty I haue in Chriſt, I owght to vſe the ſame charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſupport towardes him. And this appeareth manifeſtly, boeth in <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 15. 21.</note> the ſame, and other places: where <note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 12. et 10. 25 Rom. 14. 14</note> S. Paul which gaue owt that decree to be kept, teacheth generally the free vſe of al meates, ſo yt be withowt offence.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>washing of feet,</hi> commanded vnto the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, it is nothing but a trope or borowed ſpeach: wherby o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ur Sau. Chriſt willeth them, and, in them, vs al, not for a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, but to the end of the world, that, for help one of an oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, eche should ſubmit him ſelf to other, euen vnto the doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the baſeſt offices. which may appear, in that he place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 13. 17.</note> perfect bleſſednes in the obediens to that commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which he would neuer haue doen, in the washing of the feet: So that this commandement, might wel be of them (as of vs) fulfilled, withowt that particular actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of washing eche anothers feet.</p>
            <p>But here obſerue, I pray yow, how dangerously yow beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue your ſelf, in reſpect of the common Aduerſary. <note n="e" place="margin">1.

King. 18. 13.</note> hundreth prophetes, kept of one man alone. Then he ſaith, <hi>that it is Anabaptistical, vpon a miraculous change, and that of one, to make a general rule:</hi> But yt is his great faut, not to know, that the miracles wrought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certein, haue a general doctrine, and ſerue to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our faith, in al our neceſsities.

Chriſt to this, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe which ſeek the kingdome of heauen, shal haue al other thinges caſt vnto them.</p>
            <p>Yf I had giuen hope, of the aſsiſtance of god, in thinges taken in hand withowt a calling, or in a calling, withowt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the lawful meanes, which god putteth in our handes, then yt had bene <hi>Anabaptiſtical:</hi> but to aſſure the church of the aſsiſtance of god, in goeing abowt that, which I hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ld for commanded of hym, when yt aſſaieth al lawful mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it can, ys more <hi>skilful diuinity,</hi> then yow can ſtayn wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th al the skil yow haue. I could haue browght other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Dauid, Salomon &amp;c. but that <hi>one of Saul,</hi> was more preſsing, the force whereof noted by me, yow clean pas by.</p>
            <p>Nether hath the lord doen this, in certain particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: but generally, in his whole church. For when he would make his tabernacle, which was a figure of the church, he commanded an exquiſite workmanship in yt. where, albeit there was nothing more gros and rude then the Iſraelites,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7987:37"/> as thoſe which had bene many yeares houlden in vile slau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, occupied in clay and dirt, and al other kinde of drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: yet the lord gaue numbers of ſuch dexterity, in working<note place="margin">Ex. 31. 1. 6. and. 36. 1.</note> al kinde of broidery, and riche workes, as if they had bene browght vp in al liberal exerciſe, and norished as Princes children.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, when as the lord furnished vnto the church vnder the law, able men for this function, notwithſtanding he vſed not that larges toward yt, which he doeth now tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards vs: they are to iniurious vnto the grace of god, towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the church now, which, vnder pretence of want of able men, would driue this order owt of yt.

            <p>To that I alledged, <hi>that the common vuealth gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diuiſ. 17. p. 646.</note> 
               <hi>must be framed vnto the church, and not the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch gouernment vnto the common vuealth, as the hangin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to the hovus, and not the hous to the hanginges:</hi> he anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wereth, as thowgh I had ment, that the <hi>form, of the gouernment must be changed, and made the ſame with the form of the church gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> which is an open wreſting of my wordes, ſeing al know, <hi>that to be framed according to another thing, is not al one as to be made the ſame with yt:</hi> oneles he that commandeth
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7987:37"/> his hanginges to be framed to his hows, commandeth that his hows and hanginges should be made the ſame, or that the Maſter which biddeth his ſeruant frame him ſelf to him, biddeth hym to giue commandement for commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, chek for chek, blow for blow.</p>
            <p>Therfore, my meaning could not be ſuch, but it was as it is, which I alſo expounded in the example of the Prince, the principal part of the common wealth: <hi>that if there vuere any cuſtome, prerogatiue, or pomp in the common vueal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th, before the Prince ioyned him ſelf to the church, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the order of a church vuel eſtablished, that that shou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ld be corrected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if I had had any ſuch meaning, as he ſurmiſeth, yet our common wealth could haue receiued no ſuch change by this: conſidering that I had boeth declared my liking of yt, and shewed how the form thereof, reſembleth the form of the church gouernment. wherby alſo appeareth, what a<note place="margin">p. 180. of his booK.</note> shameful slaunder it is, which he ſurmiſeth of me, that I <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld haue Princes throw down their crownes, before the Seniors of the ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch &amp;c.</hi> which I preciſely preuented with plain wordes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I knw with whom I had to doe.

            <p>Now he hath left the point of his slaunderous ſpeach in me, in his anſwer to my argumentes, as a bee which hath loſt her ſting: he is altogither vnprofitable.

Nether occupations nor dignities haue any ſuch mark of vncleannes, or profanation, that th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey may not be coupled with the church miniſtery: when the miniſtery is ſuch, as togither with their profeſsions, they may alſo execute yt: in which kinde is the Eldership of the church. I omit, that the D. hath here patched togither a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of M. Caluin before anſwered, and another of M. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za:<note place="margin">1. Chap. 1. diuiſ.</note> which, in that ſens he pretendeth them, are quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to another. yt is therfore meruail, if he can make of them one vniform, and euen anſwer.</p>
            <p>Now he hath ranged and roued, almoſt in this whole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation:<note place="margin">Chap. 3. p. 656.</note> he muſt haue <hi>leau</hi> to run bak the way he came, to ſee whether he hath let any of his peeces fal. And firſt, good reader, he dasheth the in the face, with two open vntruthes, in the forehead of this chapter. For the order of the church propounded by vs, is vniform, and ſtanding, as it is left vs in the word of god: and not as he ſurmiſeth, varying <hi>according to the numbre of the churches.</hi> Alſo for ceremonies variable by circunſtance, it is frankly confeſſed: that they owght to be determyned of, by aduiſe of the church Synod, aſſembled eſpecially of the flower and moſt ſufficient of the eccleſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al gouernours, ſent by conſent of the reſt, if al (as yt happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth) can not be coueniently there.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is nether affirmed, nor euer practiſed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny church where this order is, or hath bene vſed: that he <hi>that is choſen may not refuſe yt.</hi> So that, if there be any that thinketh his honour ſtayned, in being ioyned in counſail of church matters with poor men, when there ether are not, or are not enow of others: he hath not to complain, ſeing he is at his choiſe. Albeit, if any man should be ſo myneded, to think skorn to hear the ſentence of a poor man, in that he is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7987:40"/> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: let the ſame know, that he <note n="a" place="margin">Pro. 17. 5.</note> 
               <hi>reprocheth god that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de hym poor.</hi> And if he be lawfully appointed, to this office: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doeth not disdain the man, but <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 18. 18</note> Chriſt hym ſelf. Th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfore, if he haue any fear of god before his eyes: he wil from hence forth be ashamed to vſe this for a reaſon. Beſide that, he thus ouerthroweth the high court of Parliament: where, with the nobility, are ioyned in conſultation the commons of the Realm: where alſo the eſtates, being vnequal, the voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces notwithſtanding are equal. I omit, how that if there we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re any inconuenience in this, that the <hi>ſentence of the Paſtor and other not ſo rich or ſo noble, should weigh down the ſentence of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man he ſpeaketh of:</hi> yet him ſelf hath deliuered vs of yt, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich telleth vs, that the <hi>lord of the town, or ſome other of countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 136.</note> 
               <hi>wil lead away the rest of the church:</hi> how much more then, shal he be able to lead away two or thre? Thus he plaieth on bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth handes: for there he pincheth at the nobility, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he pretendeth, as if he were tender ouer their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>His third reaſon is anſwered <note n="a" place="margin">Cha. 2. di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiſ. 9.</note> before: likewiſe his <note n="b" place="margin">Cha 2. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſ. 3. &amp; 17.</note> fourth: his <note n="c" place="margin">Cha. 1. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſ. 6 &amp; 7.</note> fift: his <note n="d" place="margin">Cha. 2. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui. 2. and 3.</note> ſixt, and <hi rend="sup">a</hi> ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th. As for the eight, of <hi>partial affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and contentions which would enſue:</hi> it is plentifully anſwered, <note n="f" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this booK. pag. 2 9. 134. 147. 288. 227.</note> in the queſtion of the church election. For if theſe be friuolous reaſons againſt thoſe ecclehaſtical actions, where the whole church hath intereſt: much more are they, againſt the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blies of thre or fower onely, and thoſe of the choiſeſt. the<note place="margin">e Cha. 2. de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiſ. 1.</note> ninth is alſo <note n="g" place="margin">Chap. 2. diuiſ 13.</note> anſwered.</p>
            <p>The tenth, that it <hi>would be to great extremity to punish for one faut twiſe:</hi> is a fals principle, taken from the Pelagian herefy. For the Magiſtrate may appoint fower kinde of punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, for one faut, if he think good, to be executed at diuers tymes: ſo that they altogither and ioyntly, exceed not the quantity of the faut. And, by his reaſon, the Magiſtrate shal be shut owt, from his right of punishyng ſyn: if it fal owt, that the lord by ſome punishment laid vpon the offender, preuent the Magiſtrates punishment, eſpecially when the punishment is in ſuch ſort, that it may appear that yt was ſent for that ſpecial faut: for examples ſake, if of dronken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb facs="tcp:7987:40"/> he fal into ſome ſiknes: na, thus the lordes ſword, is w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rung owt of his hand. For nether may he punish thoſe fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, which the Magiſtrate punished before: and if he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish a man in this life, he hath bound his handes, for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing him in the world to come. For in deed the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch diſcipline, is the punishment, or rather the correction of the lord: in a far other kinde, and to an other end, then the ciuil punishment. But I haue shewed, that boeth theſe<note place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this booK. pag. 3.</note> were practiſed amongeſt the people of god, for one and the ſame faut. And is not this, in the Apoſtles, to condemn the holy goſt him ſelf? For if it be true, which he ſaith, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne had ſtollen, or committed adultery, it had not bene lawful for them to haue vſed the eccleſiaſtical cenſure, leaſt the offender being after apprehended, and punished ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lawes of the common wealth where he liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, should thereby haue bene wronged. Beſide that, the D. accuſeth al our Bishops, which for diuers cauſes punis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hable by the lawes of the Realm, ſend forth their excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications: yea al the elder churches, which did not leau to proceed in eccleſiaſtical cenſures againſt thoſe, whom the heathen Princes had iuſtly punished.

I omit his often ieſting, at the Paſtor, by calling him diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers tymes in contempt, <hi>Maſter Paſtor:</hi> which the Angels them ſelues dare not doe: when as him ſelf can not deny, but to haue a Paſtor in euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, is the ordinance of god.

               <note place="margin">Chap. 4. p. 658.</note> 
               <hi>apointed, is</hi> anſwered <note n="a" place="margin">1. Chap.</note> before: likewiſe the <note n="b" place="margin">2. Cha. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſ. 2. and 3</note> ſecond and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rd: the fourth is a gros asking of that in queſtion. In the fift M. <hi>Caluins and</hi> M. <hi>Bezas</hi> firſt and laſt ſentences, are violently drawen from their meaning: as hath bene <note n="c" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part. of this booK p. 80. and. 134. &amp;c.</note> shewed. The middle ſentence, beareth no ſuch argument, as he would gather: for there is no word, that shutteth owt the neceſsity of the Eldership vnder a Chriſtian Magiſtrate: no, or that maketh it, ſo much as les neceſſary vnder a Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, then vnder perſecution. For the word, <hi>eſpecially,</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned, vnto the gouernment which the Bishop had ouer the Elders: ſo that if there be any thing to be gathered of th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, it is this, that the Bishop should not haue ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence ouer the Eldership, when ther is a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, as when there was not. And how doeth not he blush, to alledg mens ſentences directly contrary to their iudgmentes, playnly declared in this matter of the Elders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip: which counteth yt ſuch a faut, to ſet one writer againſt another. I omit other places, owt of M. <note n="d" place="margin">Epist. 11. 14. 20, 83.</note> Beza, where this cauſe is confirmed boeth generally in the vnuariable go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the church, and particularly in this caſe of the Eldership. The reaſons alledged of M. <hi>Muſculus and Gualter</hi> haue bene anſwered. His ſixt reaſon of <hi>giuing no more here, to the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, then to Nero:</hi> is but onely ſaid, the vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th wherof shal appear in place.</p>
            <p>Seing therefore, the lord hym ſelf hath once ſet this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment by Elders in the church, and that no man may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplace, which he hath placed: ſeing yt is a ſupply of that in the church, which the moſt ſufficient and moſt diligent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the word, is not able to perform by yt ſelf alone:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7987:41"/> ſeing the churches vnder the law, and in the Apoſtles ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes could not want this help: and ſeing the antiquity w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich folowed for diuers hundred yeares, partly held the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, partly lamented the want of yt, and partly left markes and footinges whereby, being loſt, yt might be recouered again: ſeing further, the liberality of god towardes the ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch is commended, in that for the greater ſafety of yt, he would haue many watchmen of one church. Laſtly, ſeing the Apoſtel in the perſon of Timothe, chargeth moſt ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly al the Miniſters of the word, with the keping of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, vntil the appearing of our Sa. Chriſt: let vs conclude that the Eldership ordeined for the gouernment of the ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch onely, is the perpetual and vnchangable decree of god, and therefore not onely in <hi>comon wealthes</hi> where <hi>many,</hi> but alſo in Monarchies where one gouerneth, not onely in <hi>time of perſeqution,</hi> but alſo in time of peace, to be retey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>Again, forſomuch as the Apoſtel ordeined thes Elde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rs, church by church: foraſmuch as giuing a rule of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of al, aſwel of churches in the countrey, as in the City, he inioyned the praeſeruation of this order: forasmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch alſo as the goſpel, whereof this is a part, brake forth owt of Ieruſalem into al places, not into cities onely: and for that, the Paſtor of an vplandish town, is no more able to doe al that is to be doen in his church, then the Paſtors in the city: conſidering alſo that the churches, as dawghters and coheirs of one father and mother, owght to enioy like priuileges: ſeing further the Bishop to whome this Elders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip is aſsiſtant, hath bene shewed to belong aſwel to chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the country, as in the city: finally, foraſmuch as the vſe boeth of he churches vnder the law, and of thoſe after the Apoſtels tymes, lead vs hereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to: yt is likewiſe browght, to pas, that this Eldership owght to be in al churches, not in thoſe onely which <hi>are planted in great cities.</hi>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7987:42"/> when he would <hi>brag of,</hi> and ſet the higheſt price, he hath va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued twelue of the beſt of them at no more, then <hi>one poor halin Cambridg or Oxford, is able to yeeld.</hi> yea then they were at, Queen Maries tyme: when there <hi>vuere common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in euery one ſome, vuhich diſſembling for fear, vuere not vuithstanding able to confute al Papiſtes &amp; Anabaptistes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he can anſwer nothing. That <hi>the offices came, from the bottomles pit of hel:</hi> may partly appear by that which I haue <note n="a" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part p. 616.</note> alledged, partly in that the names of Prebendaries &amp;c. are not to be found in any godly or pure writer, but in the dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gges of the canon law. For further vnderſtanding of which diſorders, I refer the reader to that which M. Caluin <note n="b" place="margin">Inſt. 4. bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oK chap. 5. ſect. 10. p. 746.</note> write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th of them: who peinteth them owt in their colours. And where I shewed, that to <hi>look for any good vnto the church in the Popes inuention, is to look to be fed vuith the Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice egges, and to be clad vuith the spiders vueb:</hi> he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that <hi>the Pope, as the Ethnickes, may make good lawes:</hi> which is vntrue, in matters belonging to the church, eſpecially in ſo great a matter, as the appointing of an office. I wil not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but they may deuiſe good lawes for the commodity of this life: but yt can not be shewed, that euer the lordes peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fetched their lawes to gouern the church by, from the heathen, much les from the Pope, which is the head of the heathen.</p>
            <p>Therefore al may ſee, what a ſinguler profit boeth the ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch and common wealth should haue: if they were conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Colledges, for the bringing vp of ſcholers, which they would yeeld (as I think) in greater numbre, then boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th the vniuerſities doe now, with furniture of profeſsions in al good knowledg: where now, they ſerue but for the fatting vp of a few, and thoſe ether vnworthy to be norished of the Almes of the church, or els whoſe preſence is neceſſary in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, and dutiful by reaſon of paſtoral reſidence. wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erein, as wel againſt theirs, as againſt our vniuerſitie mens
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7987:42"/> non reſidence: I refer the reader to the ſpecial tractate the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="748"/> That they <hi>should ſerue for rewardes, to thoſe which haue ſpent much tyme in getting learning:</hi> is but to fome at the mouth, that which is a shame once to conceiue in the minde. conſideri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng that by <hi>reward,</hi> he vnderſtandeth not the honeſt and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient prouiſion for his competent how should, and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient hoſpitality for the poor, which is confeſſed moſt due: but meaneth ſome ſurplice beſide this, which is <note n="a" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part. Traclat 6. chap. 5.</note> before co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed. Nether is any good to be hoped from them, whome the excellency of this office before Angels and men, doeth not content: to whom the fruit which they shal receiue day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in that by their miniſtery god is glorified, and men are ſaued, doeth not ſatisfy: finally to whom the ſpecial crown of glory, which remayneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the lyfe to come, with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient prouiſion for this preſent lyfe, doeth not make the miniſtery ſauory, vnles it be alſo ſauced, with theſe intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of wordly wealth and dignity. So that this is rather a lure, to draw hyrelinges into the church: then an honeſt prouocation, to cal in faithful Paſtors.</p>
            <p>Hereunto commeth the example of other churches, which haue pulled them down, and conuerted them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vſes: which the D. partly denieth, partly maketh no great account of. That they were pulled down, the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth: at the leaſt, of as many as I haue ether ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, or could vnderſtand of. And yt is namely recorded, of the <note n="b" place="margin">Bullin. v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon 1. Cor. 14.</note> church of Zurik: yea of al of them, M. <note n="c" place="margin">li.

            <p>This is a wonderful bouldnes, that yow dare ſay, yea<note place="margin">Diuiſ. 6. p 664.</note> and glory in yt, that S. <hi>Paul kept an other order of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then our Sau.

Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his form of ſpeach, to the eſtate of the church then, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich is nothing to our purpoſe.</p>
            <p>After, vpon confidence of M.

            <p>But mark a litle, how vnable your anſwers be, to vphould ſuch a confident inſultation. For, where this here ſpoken by a borowed ſpeach, is playnly vttered: yow are compelled to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d theſe wordes of the Apoſtle, <hi>take avuay the vui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked man amongest yovu,</hi> that <hi>is, shun his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany:</hi> which is not onely a wreſting of words, but alſo vnſitting to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the leuained bread, which S. Paule vſeth to ſet forth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7987:45"/> by. For it was not enough for the Iſraelites not to touch or vſe any leauened bread, in the celebration of the Paſouer: but they were bound to put it <hi>ovut of their</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Like violence he vſeth, towching the receiuing of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate. For where S.

For otherwiſe, as ſone as ſuch wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is committed, and withal ſo long as it is vnrepented: the ſynner is bound in heauen, and in right shut owt from the communion of the Sacrament, althowgh no man exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>But what a shameful defence this is, that one voice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth:<note place="margin">1.

               <hi>iudgeth thoſe that are none of the church:</hi> giuing to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that they had onely to vſe their cenſures vpon thoſe of the church, and that they should leaue the infidels to the iudgment of god. ſo that, if he ſay that the iudgment of the church is nothing but <hi>a looking on &amp;c.</hi> he muſt alſo expound theſe wordes, the <hi>lord iudgeth</hi> the infidels, that is, the lord ſtandeth by, and looketh on whileſt ſome other punish the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: whereto ad, that the Apoſtle aſcribeth to the church the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me word of iudging, which he taketh to hym ſelf.

            <p>To that I asked, <hi>vuhy S.

            <p>I leau to thoſe which haue the bookes, to look with w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat faith he hath cited theſe autorities, ſeing contrary to hys wont, he maketh them not to ſpeak: Beſide that, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re alledged for defence of excommunication by the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop alone, owt of them which are open enemies to that kinde of excommunication, eſpecially the later writers. I ſay, leauing that, I anſwer, that none of them (one excepted) is to purpoſe. For, albeit the 18 of math. be <hi>explaned, by the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Math. 16. and Iohn</hi> 20: yet it foloweth not therefore, that they be al one. And althowgh in the 16 of mathew and Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hn 20, togither with the preaching, the excommunication were vnderſtood: yet the place of the 18 of S.

That alledged of <hi>Muſculus,</hi> wherin it is ſaid, that <hi>he confoundeth theſe three places,</hi> is vntrue: for he exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth math. 18 to al Chriſtians, reſtrayning math. 16 to the Miniſters.</p>
            <p>As for his reaſon to proue them al one, <hi>becauſe they were al ſpoken to the Apostles,</hi> yt is friuolous: ſeing our Sa. Chriſt did not onely inſtruct them of thinges belonging to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, but alſo of thoſe that touched their priuate lyfe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd of the duties of the whole church. Of the ſame ſort is, that <hi>the ſame wordes are vſed in al three places.</hi> which is al one, as when the Prince ordeining, that one cheſt may be opened and shut by one onely, one other not ſo, but by others wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th him: he should conclude, that al haue power alike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Keis with power to lok and vnlok, be giuen to al. For this manifeſt difference, is in the maner of ſpeach, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that Math. 16, he ſpeaketh of one in the ſinguler nombre, in Iohn 20, althowgh he ſpeak in the plural, yet he vnderſtandeth yt diſtributiuely, that ys, that euery one of the Miniſters binedeth and loſeth by preaching. But in S. Math. 18, thoſe wordes being added to autoriſe the <hi>churchis</hi> excommunication, which word <hi>church,</hi> is a noun collectiue: they can not be drawen, to the particular perſon of the Miniſter.</p>
            <p>Here alſo, it is to be obſerued: that the D. hath quite ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erthrowen his difference, of the Bishop, and of another Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, in the matter of excommunication. For if in S. Math. 16 and Iohn 20, togither with the preaching of the word, is vnderſtanded power to excommunicate: al Miniſters of the word hauing by thoſe places autority to preach, it muſt fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low neceſſarily, that they al haue power committed vnto them to excommunicate. And ſo falleth, his whole cauſe: which is, that by the <hi>word of god, the Bishop onely hath the right of excommunication.</hi>

            <p>But becauſe theſe kinde of allegations be daungerous, and tend to the shaking of this inſtitution of god: and for that alowing ſometyme of excommunication as of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of god, at other ſome tymes he inſinuateth, that yt should not be exerciſed, eſpecially againſt the Prince, and nobility: leauing M. <hi>Gualter,</hi> I wil take me to hym.

So that to ſay, that Princes are not ſubiect vnto this order: is al one, as yf he should ſay, that Princes pertain no to the kingdome of heauen, are none of the church, haue no part with Chriſt &amp;c.

For that the ſeparation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in reſpect thereof, was not onely a ciuil policy, to kepe the whole from the ſik, but that there was therein vſed, a part of Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, yt may appear, for that the Prieſt had the knowledg of the cauſe, the shutting them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wt, and receiuing them in: and for that Azarias the Prieſt of the lord, with other his Aſsiſtantes, remoued the kyng owt of the temple, for the which he is commended in the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>

            <p>And if yt had bene onely a ciuil ſeparation, yet when the Princes could not be exempted from yt, for fear of a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral infecting of their ſubiectes: how much les owght they to be exempted from that ſeparation, which is <note n="a" place="margin">1.

For as for the bleſſing in the church, it is no part of the contract, but a thing annexed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nto yt. which appeareth, in that vpon the bare contract, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bleſsing: the parties (althowgh not to haue compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one with another) be <note n="d" place="margin">Math. 1. 20.</note> man and wife: and for that the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aker of that contract, is taken for an <note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 22. 23. 24.</note> adulterer. wherevpon it foloweth, that the iudgment of diuors, being meerly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blik, muſt be the ciuil magiſtrates alone. For matters of willes, it appeareth that they belong vnto the Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te: conſidering that they are occupied in the commodities of this life, and towch the diſtribution of goodes or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</p>
            <p>As for the An. reaſon, that the <hi>Bishop hauing best knowledg in thoſe thinges, may best iudg in them:</hi> it is a hook, to get al into their own handes. But I deny firſt, that they haue, or can (by their calling) haue beſt knowledg in ſuch thinges: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that there be diuerſe thinges in them, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire other knowledg, then of the law of god. And the caſe is rare, when the queſtion is, whether a legacy, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or a diuors be according to the law of god, or no: at leaſt which requireth any deep knowledg to diſſolue it.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7987:52"/> And if al that which may fal into theſe matters, were to be decided by the law of god: yet to ſit as iudg in them, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not onely knowledg, but alſo a calling, which Bishops can not haue, for the cauſes aboue alledged. Therefore it is manifeſt: that herein the Bishops are vſurpers, whereof alſo the D. may read, M. Nowels iudgment, that <hi>vuhoredo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tom. fol. 25.</note> 
               <hi>adulteries, slaunders, ſubtraction of tithes, caſes testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary &amp;c. vuhich Bishops ſometyme meddle vuith: are no more spiritual, then are murthers, theftes, oppreſſions, and other iniuries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nether wil it help him: that <hi>they exerciſe al maner of iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, in the Princes right.</hi> For, firſt it hath bene shewed, that they owght to exerciſe no ciuil iuriſdiction, althowgh it were committed vnto them. Then, how cometh it to pas, that in right of their bishoprik, withowt further commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Prince: they take vpon them theſe iudgmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of whoredome, diuorces &amp;c, euen as they found them in tyme of popery. And as for excommunication, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cenſures eccleſiaſtical, if <hi>they exerciſe them in the Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes right:</hi> it foloweth that boeth the magiſtrate may much more exerciſe them him ſelf, and appoint other then mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to doe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, boeth which, as they be abſurd, ſo are they ouerthrowen by the D. him ſelf: which thinketh it vnlawful for Chauncelors to excommunicate, for that (as I ſuppoſe) they be no miniſters.</p>
            <p>In the next, where the <hi>Chauncelors are charged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, and abſolue for money, alſo one man for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother &amp;c.</hi> he ſaith, it is the <hi>faut of the man and not of the law.</hi> which if it were true, yet it argueth the Bishops vnſufferable careleſnes of godes glorie, whoſe inſtitution is thus shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully profaned: and neglect of duty towardes the Prince, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſe ſubiectes are thus pilled. And here it is not to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that where the eccleſiaſtical ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſures in reformed churc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hes, are exerciſed withowt a penny charge vnto any perſon: our churches, partly by reaſon of the Archbiſ. and Bishops,

Therfore if the Archbishops and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons wil needes take more vpon them, then them ſelues be able to beweld: at the leaſt, let them pay their ſeruantes wages, and not thus burden the church. But thus the reader may ſee, how vnworthely the Archbishops, Bishops and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chdeacons deal with the church, which not content them ſelues to vſe tyranny ouer yt, and to take vpon them of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir priuate autority, which belongeth vnto other with them, haue alſo brought it into bondage vnder their ſeruantes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, I mean Chauncelors, Comiſſaries &amp;c.

               </gap>ith which tyme, althowgh <hi>M. Caluin, Bucer, Martyr, and Beza,</hi> haue bene shewed to haue ſo expounded the place, yet his accuſation is vnrepealed: whereby al theſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned men, with many others ſtand charged ſtil by him, as <hi>daliers with the ſcripture.</hi> But what, think yow, doeth he anſwer, to this whole colledg of godly learned men? he oppoſeth the <hi>expoſition of certain fathers.</hi> who would haue looked for this anſwer at his hand, in ſetting one writer againſt another, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thowt a tittle of reaſon, wordes onely excepted, which hath ſo bytingly, <note n="b" place="margin">page 65.</note> condemned yt in other.</p>
            <p>Theſe learned men, were not ignorant of thoſe expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: nether did they lightly depart, from the interpretation of the auncient writers. For whome alſo it may be anſwered, that in interpreting this place of <hi>priuate giuing:</hi> they me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not, to shut owt this office. And of M. <hi>Bullinger</hi> it is manifeſt, that <note n="c" place="margin">vpon the 12. Rom.</note> he doeth ſo alow of that, that he wil haue it vnderſtood pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of the Deaconship: ſo that yow openly abuſe his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony herein. The cauſe why the auncient fathers folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed this expoſition, is known wel enowgh to thoſe which haue bene conuerſant in them, with any iudgment: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a deſire they had, to draw al to the correction of maners ſtreyning often tymes their textes in hand, to draw them
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7987:55"/> to the preſent vſe of their churches. by reaſon wherof, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſteed of milk, they ſometimes drw bloud, I leau it to the iudgment of the learned reader.</p>
            <p>But let vs ſee, if this wrangling of his: can be conuinced, of the place yt ſelf. where firſt it is manifeſt, that it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of that ſimilitude which was drawen from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: in which the Apoſtle shewed, that <hi>as al the members ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue not one office,</hi> So in the church, euery one hath not the ſame function. wherevpon foloweth, that if this <hi>diſtributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> of money, which is a part of that explanation, should agree to al the church alike, and should not be a ſeueral office: he should quite ouerthrow his purpoſe. For he should, shew, thinges agreeing vnto al alike: in ſteed that he should haue shewed, that ſome thinges be peculiar. Yf he reply, that he had shewed thoſe before, and that here he beginneth to sh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ew the thinges, which are common to al Chriſtians alike: he is manifeſtly beaten down, by the order of the Apoſtle. For ſeing boeth that which immediatly goeth before this, and which foloweth immediately after, be publik offices: what extreme bouldnes would it be, to ſay that this in the midd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, is but priuate. If he doe giue him ſelf this licence, let him shew example, of ſuch an order.</p>
            <p>Further, the Apoſtle here maketh a partition: as it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the wordes and articles, which are inſtrumentes to part with. Now if he wil haue one membre in this partition, bigger then al the reſt, and to conteyn them al: he maketh the holy goſt (which is to be deteſted) an euil and an vneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en parter. Herevpon it cometh, that when he ſpeaketh of the dutyes, which belong to al alike: he beginneth with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <note n="a" place="margin">verſ. 9.</note> form of ſpeach.</p>
            <p>Laſt of al, yt is not to be omitted, that he vſeth the word of <hi>Diſtributor,</hi> rather then the word <hi>giuer.</hi> For althowgh it be taken ſometyme, for the giuer, yet that is but by a trope: for ſomuch as the ſame is often the diſtributor, which is the giuer: ſo that the proper ſignification being, to diſpoſe that which was giuen of others, agreeth vnto the Deacon, and not vnto one which giueth of his own. His exceptions of

               <hi>Propheſy,</hi> and <hi>widowes office</hi>

In the next being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uicted of his vntruth, he falleth to ieſting: albeyt it be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the Adm. towcheth not onely <hi>thinges in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,</hi> but ſometyme alſo, the breach of that which is eſtablis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed.</p>
            <p>To proue, that the Deacon owght not to meddle with the adminiſtration of the word and Sacramentes, I alledged firſt, <hi>that the Apostle vuilling euery one to kepe him ſelf in his boundes, boundeth the Deacons office in diſtributing of the church treaſur, and by that ſeparateth him, from thoſe vuhich haue the diſpenſation of the vuord: vuhereas, if he should preach the vuord as the other, the Apoſtle sh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ould haue made an euil partition, and pretended a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration vuhere none is.</hi> His anſwer hereunto is, that <hi>it is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſon:</hi> but why it is not, he kepeth to him ſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon was, <hi>that for ſo much as the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les hauing ſuch paſſing giftes, did finde them ſelues vnable to ſuſteyn boeth the ministeries, of the vuord, and for the poor: that therfore there can be much les novu, any able to doe them boeth togither.</hi> His firſt exception whereunto, is friuolous, and <note n="b" place="margin">Tract. 7. diuiſ. 2 pa. 758.</note> before confuted: his other that they <hi>ſpent no great tyme in prouiſion for their ſermons,</hi> is vntrue and openeth a gap to Anabaptiſm. For althowgh their giftes were greater in thoſe tymes, then now: yet they omitted not therefore, to ſtudy diligently which may appear, in that S. Paul is ſo <note n="c" place="margin">2. Ti. 4. 13.</note> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reful to haue his parchmentes browght: in that S. Peter had <note n="d" place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 16</note> red S. Paules epiſtles ſo diligently: Likewiſe that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes in tymes paſt which had extraordinary giftes, vſed great diligence in reading, as it may appear in Daniel. whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch, notwithſtanding he was ſo wiſe, ſo expert in the tonges, and had ſo oft and ſo wonderful reuelations: yet <note n="e" place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> ſtudied the propheſy of Ieremy. And in a word, of them al, S. Peter pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth, that <note n="f" place="margin">1.

               </gap> that they tawght.</p>
            <p>Nether was this of pleaſure, and a thing which they might ether doe or leau vndoen, but a commandement: as it is to be ſeen in the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Timothy, which had giftes ſo much the more excellent then the Deacons, as his office of Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſtship, was higher then the Deaconship. For he is <note n="a" place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 13. 25.</note> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>to read, to meditate and to preach,</hi> ioyning one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and that not sleightly but with <hi>attention,</hi> yea that<note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> he should <hi>dvuel in them,</hi> or be as it were shut vp and enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in them: thereby noting the great diligence that was to be beſtowed, as wel in reading and ſtudying, as in preachi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, And thus went the building of god ſingulerly forward, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the giftes which came withowt their labor miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: they labored alſo after ether encreas of them, or getting of nue, by the ordinary meanes prouided of god in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
            <p>Again, S. Paul reckoning vp, al the miniſters of the word:<note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> the Deacon not being there, it foloweth that he is no mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the word. And here the D. is plainly found, at ſtrife with him ſelf. For he confeſsing, that there is in that place, <note n="b" place="margin">308.</note> 
               <hi>a complet and perfect diuiſion of the miniſteries of the word, and withal that</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">309.</note> 
               <hi>the Deacon is not there conteyned:</hi> doeth notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ſing a clean contrary ſong.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, it is diligently to be obſerued, that S. Paul in deſcribing this office, requireth not that they should be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 8.</note> or apt to teach: which notwithſtanding being (by the An. iudgment) the cheif point belonging vnto him, should ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue bene moſt abſurdly left owt. Laſtly, if the Deacons office had bene, togither with the Stewardship of the church trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to haue preached and adminiſtred the ſacramenres: yt muſt folow, that his office muſt haue bene a greater office, then the Paſtors, as that which requireth greater giftes for executing boeth that which the paſtor doeth, and more to: which being abſurd, that is alſo, whereof this foloweth. That monſter, which remaineth in this diuiſion: I wil ſet vpon, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I shal haue run throwgh that which pertayneth vnto this
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7987:56"/> matter, as it lieth in the 14 Tract.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>As I did not before deny, ſo now I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes him to haue bene Phillip the Euangeliſt, and not Phillip the Apoſtle, which is mentioned Actes the 8: and hould as before, that <hi>he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by vertue of his Euangeliſtship, and not by vertue of his Deaconship, vuhich vuas then ceaſed, for that the church vuhereunto he ſerued vuas ſcattered.</hi> Againſt which anſwer, his autority owt of the <hi>Actes 21, to proue that he was ſtil Deacon:</hi> is quite contrary, to him ſelf. For it affirmeth of the tyme paſt, that he was, before Paules arriual vnto Caeſarea, Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: not that he was ſo, when he arriued. For then the interpreters, would haue turned the participle, which ſerueth boeth for the tyme paſt and preſent, according to the circumſtance of the place, <hi>which is one of the ſeuen,</hi> and not <hi>vuhich vuas:</hi> So th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, here we haue the common conſent of al interpreters, fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly againſt the D. namely, that Phillip was not then Deacon when S. Paul came to Ceſarea, but had bene before.</p>
            <p>That of M. <hi>Gualter,</hi> maketh alſo againſt hym: which placeth the Deacons office, in the diſpoſing of the church treaſure, and that they preached not, but in tymes of neceſsity. So that where M. Gualter permitteth preaching no more vnto Deacons, then yow doe baptim vnto wemen: yow wil haue it, their ſtanding office.</p>
            <p>The difference betwene a <hi>Priest and a Deacon,</hi> browght owt of <hi>Auguſtin and Epiphanius,</hi> can by no meanes ſtand: conſideri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng that, that impoſition of handes whereby giftes were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily giuen, which Phillip abſteyned from, he did not abſteyn from, onely as Deacon, but alſo as he was Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt: ſeing that was a thing peculier vnto the Apoſtles, and a proper note, whereby the lord magnified their miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e, aboue al other miniſteries whatſoeuer. So that, it is no good reaſon to ſay, that <hi>Phillip could not by laying on of his handes giue the holy gost, therfore he was a Deacon:</hi> conſidering that, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Euangeliſtes, nor Prophetes them ſelues meddled wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th that kinde of laying on of handes, which is there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:7987:57"/>
            <p>And if Phillip were then Deacon, he was Deacon of the church of Ieruſalem, whereunto he was choſen. But it ys manifeſt, he was not Deacon there: conſidering that S. Luke after his departure from thence, and preaching in Samaria, and certein other places, bringeth hym to Caeſarea, where<note place="margin">Acto. 8. 40. Act. 21. 8.</note> he leaueth hym as a houshoulder and towndweller. ſo that vnles he dare ſay of Phillip that he was a continual non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident: yt can not be, that he was Deacon after his departure from Ieruſalem.</p>
            <p>But let vs graunt, that Phillip was boeth a Deacon and Euangeliſt, which is notwithſtanding abſurd: ſeing that the Apoſtles confeſſed them ſelues inſufficient, to ſuſteyn that burden, togither with their preaching miniſtery. I ſay let vs graunt that, yet forasmuch as he can not deny, but that yt belongeth vnto the office of an Euangeliſt to preach: how is he able to proue, that Phillip preached rather by vertue of his Deaconship, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Euangeliſtship. So that onles he be ſo bould, as to deny that Phillip was there no Euangeliſt: he gaineth nothing, by al this travail. For otherwiſe, it folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that Phillipes example, wil not warrant the Deacons preaching: except he haue, ſome other miniſtery of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rd, ioyned with yt.</p>
            <p>Therefore, let not him any more pretend, the autority of the godly writers: but confes, as the truth is, that this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument was miniſtred hym owt of Pigghius: who vpon this<note place="margin">Piggh. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſ. 11.</note> example of Phillip, affirmeth (as he doeth) that <hi>the Deaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ns may preach, euen as the Priestes</hi> doe. As for Auguſtin, he goeth abowt (althowgh not ſo aptly, as I haue declared) rather to shew, that the Deacons might not lay on their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: then that yt belonged, vnto them to preach. which may appear, in that he doeth not permit them to conceiue the prayers, wherunto the people should anſwer: which notwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thſtanding is les, then to preach.</p>
            <p>I shewed, that <hi>by the ſame reaſon, they are houlden</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diuiſ. 2. p. 583.</note> 
               <hi>from the administration of the ſupper, they ovught alſo to be barred from that of baptim: conſidering that, it is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7987:57"/> a miſerable rending in ſonder of thinges vuhich god hath ioyned, but alſo giueth occaſion, or rather, being crept in, maynteyneth a daungerous error: vuhich is, that men esteme ſome holier thing to be in the ſacrament of the holy ſupper, then in baptim.</hi> To this he anſwereth, that <hi>the reaſon of this difference is: becauſe yt is mentioned that Phillip baptized, and not that he adminiſtred the ſupper.</hi> where, by the way, let the reader obſerue, that vpon two particuler examples, which he alſo vntruly pretendeth, he would ground a doctrine, <hi>that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acons owght to preach,</hi> althowgh he be able to shew no rule, nor commandement for yt: which notwithſtanding he vtterly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth in vs, althowgh yt be shewed, to haue bene do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en generally. Secondly, how he reaſoneth negatiuely of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority, <hi>that it was not doen, becauſe yt ys not ſo written:</hi> yea which is more, that yt <hi>owght not to be doen,</hi> another thing alſo, which he reprocheth vs with.</p>
            <p>Now, as for his anſwer, yt is to friuolous. For, althowgh yt be a good reaſon in the direction of the church, to ſay, th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere is nothing wtitten towching yt, therfore it is not to be admitted: yet in the practiſe of that which is preſcribed to be doen, it is an euil argument to ſay, <hi>it is not written, therfore yt was not doen:</hi> much more, <hi>that yt may not be doen.</hi> For, when our Sau. Chriſtes actes, <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 20.</note> were not al written: is yt any marueil, althowgh al that Phillip did, be not written? And by his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Bishops owght not to adminiſter the ſupper: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that, in al the ſcripture it is not mentioned, that a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop miniſtred yt.</p>
            <p>Nether, if <hi>Phillip did not miniſter the ſupper:</hi> foloweth yt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he had not autority to adminiſter yt, aſwel as bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim: except he think, that our Sa. Chriſt had not autority, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel to adminiſter baptim, which he did <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 4. 2.</note> not, as to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ſupper, which <note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 22. 19.</note> he did.</p>
            <p>To that wherein I noted <hi>the diſorder in our church, permitting to one that can not preach, the administration of the ſupper, and not to the Deacon</hi> (as they cal hym) <hi>whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch
<pb facs="tcp:7987:58"/> can preach:</hi> he anſwereth, that the <hi>one is called thereto, the other is not.</hi> where he muſt needes mean, that the one is lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereto, and the other lawfully shut therefro: which is an asking, of that in queſtion.</p>
            <p>My reply to his obiection <hi>of Steuens oration,</hi> that <hi>yt vuas no</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diuiſ. 3. p. 584.</note> 
               <hi>ſermon, but a defence of hym ſelf against his accuſations:</hi> is clear. For yt appeareth, that the high Prieſt and Scribes<note place="margin">Act. 6. 11. 15 &amp; 7 1. 2.</note> &amp;c. were there ſet in iudgment, the fals witneſſes were ſet vp againſt hym, he was demaunded whether the accuſation were true, and vpon that demaund began his oration. now, let hym shew ſuch a form of preaching, to haue bene vſed in any church.</p>
            <p>Yt is alſo vnlike, that the high Prieſt and Scribes would permit hym <hi>to preach:</hi> when as they had forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les before. but to giue hym leau to anſwer to his accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, was needful for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: therby to mayntein that viſard of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whereby they pretended an exact obſeruation of the law, which was, that no man should be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned vnheard. And ſo, if he wil haue this a ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he shal yet gain nothing: conſidering that he had not this power by his miniſtery of Deaconship, but by commaundement of the Councel, that had power to require an account of that, which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in diſputation, with thoſe of the Colledg of Liber tynes &amp;c.</p>
            <p>His proof, <hi>that it was in the Synagog,</hi> is firſt withowt al warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: there being not a word thereof, in the ſcripture. And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made in Ieruſalem, if it had bene a ſermon: it is liker, to haue bene in the temple. Nether, if yt were <hi>in the Synagog,</hi> hath yt any force to proue a ſermon: onles he think, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one which pleaded his cauſe in Paules Conſiſtory, in Queen Maries tyme, <hi>made a ſermon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he alſo reprehended them sharply,</hi> is no other thing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the Martyrs of god haue doen with vs, which, I think he wil not ſay to haue preached, by vertue of any eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal function. althowgh I confes, that that is not to be lightly doen, and withowt ſome eſpecial directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereof the lord, in ſuch tymes, doeth furnish his: otherwiſe thoſe that are priuate men, owght to content them ſelues, with a ſimple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd playn defence of the truth.</p>

            <p>I graunt, a man may <hi>defend hym ſelf againſt fals accuſations in a ſermon:</hi> but that is not, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſtandeth iudicially accuſed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke a malefactor, as S. Steuen did. whoſe <hi>vuhole oration,</hi> how apt a <hi>purgation</hi> yt is (which he denieth): the reader may fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tch from M. Caluin, vpon that place: that I be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled, to lenghthen my book by ſo long translations. Againſt M. Beza (in quoting of whome, I failed) are oppoſed <hi>Gualter and the Centuries:</hi> of whoſe ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, which is truer, let it be iudged of the reaſons on boeth ſides. whether in the two next diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the Anſ. shifteth his gros ouerſight, let the reader iudg: eſpecially, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as his pretence, that <hi>the Adm. aſsigned the deacon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to be onely in handling the church treaſure,</hi> is vntrue. For nether haue they the word, <hi>onely,</hi> nor any thing of that value: and it is manifeſt, that their drift was, onely to shut owt the Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word and ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. ſo that, in taking his wordes, in that ſens which he now would haue them: in effect he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth, hym ſelf to haue but trifled with the Admonition: chaunging the prickes, which they had ſet hym to shoot at and roving after a mark of his own finedi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. In the next, I alledged, that <hi>if the Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ship vuere grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, a step to the miniſtery, yet thereof folovueth not that yt is the mynistery: but contrarivuiſe, that it is not, and therefore ovught not to doe thinges pertayning to the miniſters.</hi> To this he anſwereth, <hi>he concluded not ſo:</hi> which I confes, can not be forcibly won owt of his wordes. But he ſaith, <hi>he might haue ſo concluded:</hi> which is abſurd, and al one as if he should ſay, that the foot of the ſtayer is the ſame with the top, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it, in aſcending, leadeth. And how dare he ſay that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7987:59"/> he might haue <hi>ſo reaſoned:</hi> when as to the argument, which I drw from theſe wordes of hys, he can anſwer nothing, how could he haue hurt vs, with this, which he ſuffereth to be dr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuen ſo flat, vpon the head of his own cauſe.</p>
            <p>Vuhere afterward, to proue it no <hi>ſtep to the miniſtery,</hi> I alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,<note place="margin">Diuiſ. 7. p. 587.</note> 
               <hi>that the giftes are diuers, and that one may vuel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the church treaſure vuhich, for vuant of vtterance, should neuer be fit Minister:</hi> he anſwereth, that the <hi>Bishops and Deacons giftes, required 1. Timot. 3, doe not much differ,</hi> which is a great vntruth. For it is required of the one, that he should be boeth able to teach, and of long tyme in profeſsion of the goſpel, nether wherof, is required of the Deacon: when notwithſtanding, the firſt onely of them, maketh a greater difference, as towching the duty of preaching which is in queſtion, then if he had made them to differ, in an hundreth other thinges. he addeth <hi>that they may be put by the mynistery, for their leud lyfe:</hi> which is a meer miſpending of the tyme, for ſo may the Clokkeper or the Sexten. Again, <hi>that Ambroſe with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, expound yt ſo:</hi> which is likewiſe, that being before confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by me: eſpecially, when other learned men, by his own confeſsion, leauing their expoſition, take this which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
            <p>Further, that <hi>vtterance ſufficient for the diſtribution of the church money, is ſufficient alſo for the miniſtery of the word:</hi> which muſt of neceſsity be his anſwer, if he ſpeak to the purpoſe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, it is to abſurd: the confutation whereof (if it deſerue any) may be fetched from that <note n="a" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part of this booK. Tract. 5.</note> before handled. Althowgh, if that were true, the argument is not avoided: oneles he wil alſo ſay, that there is as great knowledg and as deep iudgm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the ſcriptures, required for the diſpoſing of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch treaſure, as for the preaching of the word. vnto the other reaſon, which I browght againſt this, <hi>that the deaconship should be a step to the miniſtery,</hi> raiſed owt of the ſame place: he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nothing.</p>

            <p>Likewiſe, that owt <hi>of M. Beza,</hi> is againſt hym.

            <p>And albeit there might be ſome other vſe of them at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, beſide this cariadg: yet that their preſence was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in this reſpect, it is manifeſt, not onely becauſe oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe he might haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> order, that they should haue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men after, withowt ſtaying ſo great a company, for their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes: but eſpecially vpon the wordes of Eſra, which aſsigneth<note place="margin">verſ. 28.</note> the cauſe of theyr election vnto that charge, to haue bene, for that the money and plate being conſecrate to a holy v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, yt behoued them which were likewiſe conſecrated, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the cuſtody of yt.</p>
            <p>Now, if the Anſ. should ſit in iudgment of this act of Eſra, and iudg by his Canon law, which he hath here ſet down: th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is godly learned Prieſt, hath already receiued the blak ſtone or ſentence of condemnation. For were there not as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and as wiſe for that purpoſe in the company, as ether the Prieſtes or Leuites were? were there not of the Princes, which for their skil in fight, and for the trayn which folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, were more able to make head with the enemy, that should giue the attempt to take them away: then were eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Prieſtes or Leuites? finally, is it not a meer ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſtand thus vpon the difference of a tribe or family, with los of tyme, and expens of money, in ſo great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany?</p>
            <p>But the Prieſt, appealeth to that court, where the canon of the holy ſcripture, ſitteth Iudg. which becauſe yt teache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th, that the ſafty and proſperous ſucces of thinges, depend vpon the bleſsing of god, and that that bleſsing is eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen, where thinges are doen according to his inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the ſame reſtoreth his righteouſnes agayn, and giueth hym the white ſtone of abſolution: for that the weaker, and more vnlikely, hauing the calling of god thereunto, is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7987:61"/> apt, then withowt that calling, the ſtrongeſt Sampſon th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at can be got.

            <p>But of the confutation of this, enowgh is ſaid: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, conſidering that beſide the continual practis of the ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch, with the common conſent of the learned boeth ould and nue, M.

For further confirmation of which point, the reader may haue recours to that I haue proued before: that in euery church, according to gods inſtitution, there owght to be a Bishop: eſpecially, when the Anſ. hym ſelf wil not deny, but the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop and Deacon should goe togither. Likewiſe, vnto that which hath bene ſayd of the Eldership, in this behalf: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that ſome of the reaſons, are common to boeth. As for the firſt of his exceptions, that the <hi>Deacons of one city, may ſerue al the whole Dioces,</hi> yt is to far owt of ſquare: conſidering that for one onely church, and that within one citie Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, there were ſeuen.</p>
            <p>His ſecond, <hi>that in ſcripture yt can not be shewed, that Deacons were placed any where then in cyties:</hi> is firſt to reaſon negatiuely of autority, not in the queſtion whether yt owght to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en or no, but whether yt was doen: which not we alone, but hym ſelf alſo condemneth. Secondly, if this be a reaſon to bar the churches, which are not in cities, <hi>becauſe there are none ſpecified but in great cities:</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shal by the ſame reaſon, bereue them of their Paſtors: conſidering that there is neuer a ſmal town, of which yt is any more ſaid, that yt had a Paſtor, then
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7987:62"/> that yt had a Deacon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>he ſaith that the ſame can not be shewed (oneles he be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceiued) in any auncient writer.</hi> wherein he giueth ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he toke not his wares by tale, but in gros: otherwiſe, he mig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ht better haue knowen what he hath ſuffered his <note n="a" place="margin">pag. 339.</note> book, to be ſtuffed with.

            <p>Secondly he ſaith, <hi>it had no promiſe of eternal life, nor was a ſeal of any promiſe:</hi> boeth which are vntrue. For it confirmed Noah in the promiſe that god had giuen, that he should not be drowned, with the reſt of the world.

            <p>Thirdly, he addeth, <hi>that it was a figure of the church, and therfore no ſacrament:</hi> which foloweth not. For the bread and wine in the holy ſupper, are ſo a Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt: that they are neuertheles, Sacramentes of the ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch repreſented thereby, in that, <note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> as many cornes make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne loaf, and many grapes one cup of wine: ſo many membe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rs, make one body of Chriſt, which is the church. Nether is the <hi>example of the miracles, vnaptly alledged:</hi> for they be ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to confirm the word of god, as are the Sacramentes. the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore whoſoeuer can shew, that Miniſters of the word ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght onely to be Miniſters of the ſignes, wherby it is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: sheweth, that they onely muſt be Miniſters, of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes.</p>
            <p>To proue, that the forbidding of them, from the miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word, is their forbidding from the miniſtring of the Sacramentes: I browght an argument of contraries, <hi>for that S. Paul being</hi> bidden to miniſter the word, as in th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges which goe togither, did withowt further commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, miniſter the Sacramentes: which was, belike, as a pil, that he could not wel ſwalow, conſidering that he anſwereth nothing. And if this, be not a good argument, then there is no commandement in the ſcripture, to bar wemen from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publik miniſters of the Sacramentes: for it is no where
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7987:64"/> expresly forbidden them, to miniſter the ſacramentes, but onely to miniſter the word. Yf therfore the godly learned, haue iudged them vnmeet, to miniſter the ſacramentes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the holy ſcripture hath diſabled them, to miniſter the word: yt foloweth neceſſarily, that none may haue power to miniſter the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, which hath not alſo to miniſter the word. for otherwiſe, if thoſe might publikly miniſter the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, which can not doe the word: wemen by reaſon of their ſex, are not ſo shut owt, but that they may haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into that miniſtery.</p>
            <p>Againſt this, and to proue, that there may be miniſters of the ſacramentes and not of the word: he referreth me to his <hi>pag.</hi> 483, where are cited <hi>Chryſoſtom, Ambroſe, Martyr and Caluin</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe wordes, <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to baptiſe, but to preach.</hi> For anſwer whereunto, firſt it muſt be vnderſtanded, that w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen S. Paul ſaith, that he was not ſent to baptiz: his meaning is not, that he had no maner of ſending at al to baptiz. For ſo should his own mouth condemn hym: as one which had vndertaken to doe that, wherunto he was not ſent: conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that he confeſſeth in the ſame place, that he baptized certein howshouldes. what is then his meaning? Verely eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en that, which he declareth by his practis: that he was rather ſent to preach, then to baptiz. And of ſuch negatiues by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, the Anſ. could not be ignorant: ſeing boeth he hath otherwhere made mention of them, and it is a thing which a yong diuine, and he that hath yet the pap in his mouth, may eaſely vnderſtand. As when it is ſaid, <hi>receiu my diſcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 8. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and not ſiluer:</hi> Likewiſe that <hi>thy name shal be no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>
               <note place="margin">Geneſ. 32. vſ. 28.</note> 
               <hi>called Iacob, but Iſrael:</hi> that is to ſay rather diſcipline, th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſiluer, rather Iſrael, then Iacob.</p>
            <p>Now, ſeing S. Paul did boeth preach and baptiz, by autority of god, and vertue of his calling: al may ſee, that no man can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude of this place, that one may be miniſter of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and not of the word. if any thing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, it is: that ſome may be occupied in adminiſtring the word, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſacramentes. And this is alſo an anſwer to that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7987:65"/> alledged owt of Zuinglius, towching Chriſt <hi>teaching</hi> and <hi>his diſciples baptiſing:</hi> conſidering that the diſciples preached alſo althowgh not ſo much as our Sav. Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in ſo great numbers of men and wemen to be baptized, if to the end that the Apoſtles cours of preaching should not be ſtayed, others had that charge to pour on the water, which were no Miniſters of the word: that was in the beginning, before any ordinary miniſtery of Bishop was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in the churches: and therfore nothing perteyning to our quaeſtion, which in quire, what owght to be the ordinary and ſettled gouernment of the church. For is it credible to a man of any iudgment, that ether the Apoſtle would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or theſe <hi>writers</hi> would ſay: that he <hi>committed the office of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing, vnto thoſe which were not Miniſters of the word,</hi> paſsing by the Paſtor him ſelf.</p>
            <p>Albeit, where there was no Paſtor to aſsiſt the Apoſtles: I ſee not, why the help that others, which were no miniſters of the word, gaue in that adminiſtration, should be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called baptizing: no more then he which ſerueth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, ether in carying abowt the bread, or reaching the cup, can be ſaid to haue miniſtred the lordes ſupper. So that, the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter,</hi> hauing preached of the vſe of baptim, and pronounced the wordes of the inſtitution: althowgh he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wred not the owtward element of water with his own hand, might wel be ſaid, to haue baptized them al. Beſide that, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hindereth, why the wordes Act. 10 <hi>he commanded th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em to be baptized:</hi> may not be expounded, that he comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded water to be browght, wherwith they should be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
            <p>Howſoeuer it was, yt could not be, as the D. ſaith very dangerously owt of Ambroſe: <hi>for that he would not vouchſafe to doe it him ſelf, other miniſters being preſent:</hi> conſidering that the miniſtery of the holy ſacramentes, being of the ſame natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re with the preaching of the word, is of greater excellency, then any man vpon earth is worthy to handle. Beſide that, ſeing he aloweth of <hi>Ambroſis place to the Epheſians,</hi> which affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that al <hi>men preached in the Apoſtels tymes:</hi> he can receiu; no
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7987:65"/> benefite of him in this place. For <hi>if al did preach, aſwel as baptiz:</hi> then it is true which I ſay, that none had the miniſtery of the ſacramentes, but he which had the miniſtery of the word withal: and vntrue which he affirmeth owt of Ambroſe, <hi>that ſome were ministers of the word, which were not of the ſacramentes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe is the teſtimony owt of M. <hi>Beza</hi> (wherto I haue<note place="margin">In the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat of the Deacon.</note> anſwered before) flat againſt hym in this cauſe: conſideri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng that his iudgment is, that the Deacons did boeth prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch, and adminiſter the ſacramentes ſometyme. And as there is no harmony betwene hym, and his autorityes: ſo is there none, betwene the ſentences of his autors, which he hath mashed togither. For where ſome ſay, al: other ſay, that Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes onely baptized. where he ſaith <hi>Muſculus doeth alow, that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me should miniſter the ſacramentes, which can not preach:</hi> yt is very tr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, and further, that he would rather haue yt doen by them, then by thoſe that can preach. But his ground, is vpon the miſvnderſtanding of Act. the 6: whileſt he toke <hi>the ministr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tables,</hi> which is the prouiſion for the poor, for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring of the lordes ſupper. The foundation therefore of his aſſertion, being naught: the aſſertion yt ſelf, can haue no place.</p>
            <p>The place of the 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 5. is <note n="a" place="margin">In the tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctat of the presbytery.</note> anſwered: <note n="b" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part p. 371. line 10</note> ſo is his que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. To <note n="c" place="margin">diu. 3. and 4. pa. 506. 507.</note> return again therfore to his demaund. where he asketh, <hi>what point of Anabaptiſm it is, that wemen may preach in the church, when there is no other that can, nor wil?</hi> I anſwer, that yt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth to that braunch, whereby the Anabaptiſtes hould, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may preach withowt an owtward calling of the ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch: onely, if they think it needful.</p>
            <p>Vuhere I obiected, <hi>his building vpon examples, of a fevu particular perſons, vuhich alovueth not ours, alt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovugh they be grounded vpon the general vſe of t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he churches in the Apostels tyme:</hi> he anſwereth, that he buildeth <hi>no neceſſary rule, but onely that yt may be doen vpon like occaſion.</hi> But this is but a vayn shift. For thoſe extraordinary actes whych are comendable, were doen ether by expres co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, or by ſpecial direction of the ſpirit of god: the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7987:66"/> obedience whereunto, was not at their chois to doe, or to leau vndoen. So that, if the Anſ. wil haue theſe examples, to be the directers of baptim <hi>by midwiues:</hi> they not onely may, but owght to doe yt. And if there were any ſuch caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity, as he vntruly pretendeth, and that yt might in ſuch a caſe be miniſtered by wemen: it were abſurd to leau it in the chois of the Midwife, whether she would miniſter it or no.</p>
            <p>But note (I beſeche yow) what horrible confuſion, he br<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingeth into the world, by this ſaying. For if extraordinary examples doe proue, that <hi>ſuch thinges may be doen in ſuch caſes:</hi> then may priuate men execute malefactors, becauſe Phine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es did ſo: and men may borow and neuer pay, as did the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites. If he ſay, that he addeth <hi>vpon like occaſion and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:</hi> it is true, but thereby he meaneth, yf like need or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity be. For if he mean as he owght, hauing a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar commandement of god by word, or a rare and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary inſtinct by the ſpirit of god: his anſwer is nothing to purpoſe, conſidering that he wil not (I think) ſay, that the Midwiues haue any of theſe two: and if they had, they doe it not in reſpect of the former example, but onely by reaſon of the extraordinary, ether commandement, or motion.</p>
            <p>His example of the <hi>Samaritan woman Iohn</hi> 4, is friuolous: that she should become a <hi>publik preacher,</hi> which had not yet learned her catechiſm, nor was ſcarce owt of her Chriſtian A. B. C. where it is manifeſt, that she did nothing, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to euery one: that is, that we should exhort o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne another, to goe where the knowledg of Chriſt is to be<note place="margin">Iſay 2. 3.</note> had: ſo that, she did onely, as it were, towl the bel, to draw the Samaritanes to our Sau. Chriſt, that he might preach vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to them. Nether doeth his other example, of the <hi>wemen Math. 28 which preached the reſurrection,</hi> help him. For if that may be called a publik miniſtery, it hath an expres commandeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nt of the lord, by the Angel. which commandement, as oft<note place="margin">Math. 28. 7</note> as Midwiues can shew, we wil acknowledg their miniſtery lawful: otherwiſe the general commandement, which we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<note place="margin">1.

And that M. Caluin, had no ſuch meaning as he pretendeth:<note place="margin">Inſt. 4. bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oK. chap 15 ſect. 20.</note> appeareth, in that he wil at no hand, admit baptim by we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: to whome, althowgh he oppoſe <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> yet he shewe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th not, nor (I think) is able to shew, that he alloweth, of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim by Midwiues.</p>
            <p>The next diuiſion, which sheweth that <hi>godly vuemen ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer toke the miniſtery of the vuord, but by extraordinary calling from god, approued ether by miracle, or ſome not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yſſu,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is needles,</hi> as that wherunto <hi>he agreeth:</hi> which is not ſo. For hereby is condemned, the baptizing boeth by weme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and other priuate perſons whatſoeuer: as that which hath no ſuch calling, and approbation of god. The next to it, sheweth his pouerty: which endeuoring to defend the ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ptim by wemen, was ignorant of the principal hould of that cauſe: and was <hi>needfully</hi> met with for their ſakes, whom that might trouble.</p>
            <p>In he next, he would inſinuate, that they may baptiz in <hi>the hows: for that S. Paul biddeth them teach in priuat places.</hi> where, if he had made his argument iuſt, and to claſp wel togither:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7987:67"/> he should haue concluded, that they owght to teach their howshold in priuate places, therefore they owght to baptiz in priuate places: and they owght to teach their families or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, therefore they owght to baptiz their families or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily. thus muſt the argument be cut owt, according to his meaſure: and he may as wel ſay, that a woman owght to doe the ſame in the holy ſupper. But the knot is not yet lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſed, my anſwer whereunto is, that if there were any priuate ſacramentes, as there is priuate teaching: I would accord vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that wemen hauing power to teach priuately, might alſo miniſter the ſacramentes priuately. But becauſe that the holy ſacramentes are publik, as is the preaching: his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, hath no force. For in what place, wil he lodg this argument: a woman may doe a priuate act, therfore she may doe a publik. The diuiſion folowing, being euil ſeuered of him from the next chapter, whereunto it belongeth: I leau, vntil I come vnto that matter.</p>
            <p>Now, it may pleaſe the reader, to turn vnto the 5 chapter pag. 516, which is alſo of this point in hand: towching the perſon, by whom this ſacrament should be adminiſtred. w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here firſt mark (I pray yow) a wily diſtinction, which in effect is, that he <hi>defendeth not baptim by wemen, but improueth the Adm. th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at diſaloweth yt:</hi> as thowgh one could improue the one, and not defend the other. And vnles he had browght the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Sephora, to mayntein baptim by wemen, it had bene fondly alledged: conſidering that the wordes of the Adm. are of the practis of the Apoſtles tymes, an exception agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nſt which, fetched from the tyme which was 1000 yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, might ſeme to come from him, whoſe wittes were not at home: eſpecially, when the queſtion is, what was doen, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd not what owght to be doen, as he hym ſelf now preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
            <p>Secondly he ſaith, <hi>he wil not contend with me in diuers thinges in this diuiſion, for that he misliketh their error, which condemn infantes that be not baptized, as much as</hi> I: which is not ſo. For he ſaith, that the <hi>lak of baptim, may ſeme to be a probable token and ſign of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 524.</note> which is boeth vntrue, and perillous: conſidering that not the want, but the contempt or neglect onely of the holy
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7987:67"/> Sacrament, can draw any, the leaſt apparance of the lordes wrath. Nether is that ether neglect, or contempt preiudicial to the infant, but to the parentes onely, whoſe faut that is. which notwithſtanding, can be none, where they ſeek to th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir vttermoſt, that yt may be baptized of the miniſter of the church, orderly, and conueniently: no more then it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicial, ether to the childe, or parentes vnder the law, when the infant died, before the eight day, which was the tyme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, for the adminiſtration of the Sacrament of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. For as the eight day, was to them: ſo is a conuenient, and orderly tyme, to vs.</p>
            <p>Yt is therfore a shameful dealing, that he maketh vs he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to ioyn with <hi>the Anabaptistes:</hi> which reiect childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptim, vntil they be able to make profeſsion of their faith. whereas we confes it owght to be miniſtred, with al conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſpeed: ſo it be by the miniſter, whome god hath orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yned for the ſame purpoſe. In which accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi> with vs, he windeth vp alſo (as it were in one bottom) the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed churches: where it is not permitted, that the infant in any caſe should be baptized, but by the miniſter. withal, the reader may perceiue, how idle he is, which translateth a great peece of M. <hi>Caluin:</hi> to proue that, which none denieth. whom alſo, he goeth abowt to oppoſe to him ſelf, which is of the ſame <note n="a" place="margin">Inſt. 4. bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>oK chap. 15. ſect. 20.

            <p>Yt may wel <hi>stand,</hi> that this <hi>profanation came from the Gentils, from Victor, and from the Papiſtes:</hi> Victor borowing it of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and the Papiſtes of hym. For boeth popery is like a bundel of corruptions, which being picked owt of ſundry tymes and places, it hath cocked vp togither: and the Pope is like a hog, which when he cometh into a garden, leauing the ſweet flowers, taketh him ſelf alwaies to that, which is moſt filthy in al the place. otherwiſe, the D. might deny, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corruption almoſt, to be <hi>papiſtical:</hi> ſeing they haue few, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereof ether paganiſm, or declinyng from Chriſtianiſm, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th not bene the firſt founder.<note place="margin">Diuiſ. 3. pa. 517.</note>

            <p>To that I alledged, to proue the vnlawfulnes of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7987:68"/> by Moſes wife, <hi>for that she did it, in preſence of her husband a Prophet,</hi> which is M. Caluins reaſon: he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth<note place="margin">Inſt. 4. bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oK chap. 15 ſect. 22.</note> 
               <hi>the note of the bible printed at Geneua,</hi> that <hi>he could not doe it, becauſe he was ſik, and that the Lord required it then.</hi> whether he was able or no, I wil not ſtriue: but that <hi>the lord required circumciſion,</hi> if there were no ordinary miniſter for it, doeth not appear. For, as it was an order of god, that the male childe should be circumciſed the eight day: ſo was yt alſo his order, that he should be circumciſed by a miniſter. Now, how can it be shewed, by that the lord ſtrake Moſes, that he would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, haue this ordinance changed: when as the ſiknes ſent, was a correction for the breaking of one of his orders, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd not a trumpet blown, to cal them to the breach of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And what if (as it cometh to pas) the lord had, as yt we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ſtricken Moſes by ſiknes in the childe, or that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, being of diſcretion, had hym ſelf willingly wanted cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: owght the childe therfore, by and by, with the preſent hazard of his life haue bene circumciſed? no vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But as this ſiknes, should haue inſtructed boeth father and ſon, to repent them of the former negligence, and to purpoſe the amendement of yt, when the childe should be able to abide the wound: ſo the ſiknes of Moſes, was for th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at end ſent, that he should repent him of the former negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and amend it, when it might be according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der appointed.</p>
            <p>To that alledged, <hi>that she did it in a koler:</hi> he anſwere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not. To that, <hi>that Moſes recouery is no proof of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vufulnes of it, conſidering that vuhen thinges are meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the euent, the good are condemned, and the vuicked iuſtified oftentimes:</hi> he anſwereth that <hi>the euent oft declareth the thing,</hi> which is but to waſt winde. For if it doe oft otherwiſe: it can ſerue for no reaſon, or allowance of that circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if the iudgment by the euent, be to be taken, it is there, where the cauſes doe not appear: but here the cauſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7987:68"/> of circumciſion, which is the inſtitution of god, is able to try the matter. where alſo appeareth, how affamished he is, to finde <hi>contrarietyes in my book:</hi> in that he ſuppoſeth variance in this, <hi>that here,</hi> I <hi>cal Moſes a prophet, and in another place, ſay that the priesthood vuas taken from hym, and giuen to Aharon:</hi> which is to foul an ouerſight. For boeth, there we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re Prophetes, which were no Prieſtes nor of the race of Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes: and the tyme of the deliuerance ouer of the Prieſtho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od vnto Aharon, was long after the tyme, here ſpoken of.<note place="margin">Diniſ. 4. p. 518.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt that I affirm it <hi>a neceſſary point of the Sacram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that yt be ministred by a Miniſter,</hi> he maketh many owtcryes: but they be not theſe lowd clamours, which can gain the cauſe, where there is ſo deep ſilence of reaſon: and where owt of the ſcripture, not ſo much as one ſily reaſon, is once pretended. Therefore, to cut his comb, that he crow not ſo lowd hereafter: he hath flatly betrayed his cauſe, in that, not able to alledg one reaſon owt of the word of god, he placeth the ſtrenght of this cauſe herein, that <hi>against bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing by lay men in the tyme of neceſsity, we haue</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>no ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and he hath learned men for yt.</hi> For firſt, in that he can bring no reaſon owt of the word of god, why a lay man or woman <hi>in tyme of neceſsity</hi> (as he termeth yt) may baptiz: yt is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that he owght not to haue ſet yt down. For this is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tter of doctrine, and a matter of faith: euen in that narrow ſignification, that he taketh matters of faith. this is none of the variable ceremonies, which alter by the diuerſity of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, of countreis, and of perſons: and therfore by his own rule, here an argument of the autority of the ſcripture ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiuely, is good: ſo that here it is a good argument, the ſcripture commaundeth not that lay men or wemen sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld baptiz, therfore they may not baptiz.</p>
            <p>Beſide alſo, that he doeth vs wrong, in ſaying, that <hi>it is auouched withowt proof.</hi> It might haue contented him, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſaid withowt good proof: for proof there is, whatſoeuer
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7987:69"/> yt be. where, that which he affirmeth, <hi>that the ſcripture doeth not forbid lay men to baptiz,</hi> is an vntruth: conſidering it forbidde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th that any should take <hi>honor to him ſelf, but he vuhich is called as vuas Aaron.</hi> which ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doeth manifeſtly sh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ut<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 4.</note> owt, al priuate perſons from this adminiſtration: ſeing yt is a ſingular honor, in the church of god. As for that ſtring, which he continually runneth vpon, that <hi>in tyme of neceſsity, it may be admitted:</hi> yt is but a plain asking of that in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy. For, it being confeſſed, that baptim is neceſſary, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it may be adminiſtred according to the order which god hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned: the ſtate of the queſtion is, whether there be any ſuch neceſsity of baptim, as for the atteining thereof the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rder which god hath ſet in his church, of adminiſtring it by a publik miniſter, owght to be broken. Of the ſame ſort, is his ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> idle talk, of the <hi>refuſal, neglect, or contempt of baptim:</hi> as t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>howgh, there could be any of theſe, in this caſe. If he can shew, that wemen, or lay men owght to baptiz in ſuch tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and that god hath ordeyned, that in defaut of a Miniſter, they may lay to hand: then let him talk his fil.</p>
            <p>But that I am aſſured he can not, the contrary rather may be ſeen: that the lord hath condemned ſuch rashnes, as may appear by the examples of Saul and Vzziah. For what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">1. Sam. 13. 11</note> apparance of neceſsity of ſacrificing, could there be: th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en when Saul toke vpon him, to ſacrifice. And how probab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le reaſons, in the iudgment of men, doeth he bring to defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd his fact: as that the people would otherwiſe haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hym, that the Philiſtins preſſed hym, that Samuel, came not within the tyme appointed. Likewiſe what greater ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance of neceſsity: then when Vzziah ſtayed the ark, ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herwiſe like to haue fallen. yet (theſe neceſsityes notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding)<note place="margin">2.

And verely it is al one, as if he should ſay, that if there be no magiſtrat at ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd, or none that wil doe his dutie in executing iuſtice agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nſt a murtherer: that then a priuate man may take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, to hang the murtherer.</p>
            <pb n="129" facs="tcp:7987:69"/>
            <p>Now where he propoundeth, to proue two pointes, the one that <hi>baptim by lay men is lawful,</hi> the other, that <hi>althowgh they were no fit nor lawful Miniſters, yet that the baptim is lawful:</hi> to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd the reader may haue more light wherwith to iudg of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe matters, or euer I towch the ſecond, I wil rid his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the former point. for he hath confuſedly blinded and meddled them boeth together.</p>
            <p>His autorities here, for the moſte part, are idly ſet down: as thoſe which I confeſſed before, when I graunted the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienty of this corruption. But ſeing they are here: I wil ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ak a word with them. Firſt owt of <hi>Ambroſe vpon Epheſ.</hi> 4. is ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>that al baptized.</hi> If this make any thing, to proue baptim by lay men: it proueth not onely, that they may baptiz in t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his pretended tyme of neceſsity, and priuately, but that th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey may daily, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d publikly baptiz: ſo that he, by this meanes, wil haue lay me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ordinary Miniſters. Then, let the reader ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, how vnhoneſtly he dealeth with hym. For in the ſame place, it is conteyned, how in the tyme wherein Ambroſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it was not <hi>permitted vnto lay men, nor vnto clerkes them ſelues,</hi> which were an inferior order of church men, <hi>to baptize:</hi> ſo that this Autor maketh directly againſt him, affirming that althowgh it were ſo then, yet that it is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for vs now.</p>

               <hi>Minister, is good:</hi> he <hi>thincketh it to be rather good, when it is miniſtred of a lay man, that is a member of the church:</hi> which is a foul error. For an heretical Miniſter, ſo long as he is ſuffered to enioy his miniſtery, and not depoſed therefrom: is boeth a member of the church, and a Miniſter of god, althowgh bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and euil member, and an euil Miniſter. And, it is as mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch, as if he should ſay, that the execution of a malefactor by a priuate man, which is honeſt: is rather lawful, then by a publik Magiſtrat, which is a briber. withal, let it be noted, that here the Anſ. boeth contrary to the truth, and contrary to that hym ſelf profeſſeth, hangeth the effect of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vpon the goodnes or naughtines of the Miniſter: in that, in this reſpect, he preferreth the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t miniſtred by a priuat ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being good, vnto that which is miniſtred by an euil man, althowgh he be a publik Miniſter.

               <note place="margin">Diuiſ 12. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd 13. p. 523</note> 
               <hi>vuhereof one is, that the miniſter onely should baptiz, the other, that it be doen publikly, confirmeth men greatly in that hereſy, that al are damned, vuhich are not baptized:</hi> he anſwereth nothing. Likewiſe, to that, <hi>that if a man cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ld not be ſaued vuithovut baptim, yet vue might not the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore break the order of god,</hi> he anſwereth alſo nothing, but wandereth idly in talking of the neceſsity of baptim, which we confes, as hath bene <note n="b" place="margin">In the 5. and 6. diui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſions of this chap.</note> before declared. Vuhere, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his abſurd ſaying, <hi>that the teaching of this kinde of priuate baptim, implieth no more the tying of ſaluation vnto the ſacrament, then to teach that children should be baptized before they be able to anſwer for them ſelues,</hi> I replied that <hi>the baptim of young children, hath ground in the ſcripture, but baptim by lay men or vuemen hath none:</hi> he anſwereth, <hi>that this confirmeth his ſaying.</hi> wherein, the reproch of triflyng, is to eaſy, to ſet forth his vntollerab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le abuſing of his reader. For to haue anſwered, he owght to haue tawght, a rule owt of the word of god, whereby it mig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ht haue appeared: that a priuate perſon, may take vpon him in this pretenſed caſe of neceſsity, to doe that which god hath not committed, but vnto the Miniſter: ſo that here, it is manifeſt, that he had neuer a knee to bow vnto the truth,<note place="margin">Alces. Caeſar li. 6. de bel. gall.</note> but was like that beaſt, which hauing neuer a ioynt in her leg, muſt rather break then bend.</p>
            <p>To that I alledged, <hi>of the continual, and almost gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7987:72"/> practis of the church:</hi> he anſwereth, that <hi>lay men from the beginning haue bene permitted to baptiz:</hi> whereof let the reader iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dg. In the mean ſeaſon, he is able to shew no practis of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim by wemen, but in the extreme ruines of the church: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we should haue bene ſure to haue heard of yt. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wbeit here he asketh whotly, <hi>what order of god is broken in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate baptim:</hi> euen the ſame which is broken in priuate preac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing. So that whatſoeuer hath bene <note n="a" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part p. 72. &amp;c.</note> before ſpoken of the church preaching, that it owght to be publik and not priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te: ſerueth in like maner, for the holy Sacramentes. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xt diuiſion, muſt reſt in the readers iudgment.</p>
            <p>Now remayneth the other point which is, whether baptim adminiſtred by one which is no Miniſter, althowgh againſt the word (as yt is conteyned in his pag 518 &amp;c.) be yet auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable. the D. ſaith yea. his firſt reaſon is, <hi>that otherwiſe many sh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ould goe vnder the name of Chriſtians, which were neuer baptized: and ſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I may proue my ſelf to be no Chriſtian.</hi> where I deny the argument, and withal deſire the reader to take heed of the venom: which, he going abowt in other places to hide, bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke owt here at vnawares. In an other <note n="b" place="margin">pag. 524.</note> place, he ſaid that <hi>it is a probable ſign of reprobation, if children dy withowt baptim:</hi> but here he ſetteth down flat, that <hi>they be no Chriſtians, which are not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi> So that, the children of the faithful, by his doctrine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not Chriſtians, before they be baptized: and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly condemned. whereas the truth is otherwiſe, that if he be not a Chriſtian, before he come to receiu baptim: baptim can make him no Chriſtian, which is onely the ſeal of the grace of god before receiued. And what wil he here ſay, to thoſe in tymes paſt of Theſſalia, with whome the ſacrament of baptim <note n="c" place="margin">Socra: 5. li. chap. 22.</note> was celebrated but once a year, namely at Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: were al the children paganes al that while? what wil he ſay to that tyme, wherein they receiued it not, but at their death: were they alſo al the tyme of their life paganes? I gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, boeth the cuſtomes naught: but in the mean ſeaſon, he shal doe the good Emperours, and other good men gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at iniury, in ſaying that they were heathen, or no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:7987:72"/>
            <p>His ſecond reaſon is, that <hi>there must be by this mean;</hi> ſome <hi>general rebaptization:</hi> which is the flat reaſon of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes, and in deed plain Anabaptiſm, that for a dowt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome be baptized or no, <hi>al should be rebaptized.</hi> For thus<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zuing. lib. de baptiſ. Tractat</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> they proue, that men muſt be rebaptized: becauſe (ſay th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey) they are not aſſured, whether they were baptized or no: as it is reported of Zuinglius. But it is enowgh for me, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich am aſſured of the fauour of god in Chriſt Ieſus, the thing it ſelf whereof baptim is the ſacrament: that I know my ſelf to haue bene born in that people, where the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vſe is to adminiſter baptim by a publik Miniſter, ſuch as he was. So that, vnles he can shew aſſuredly, that I was not baptized by ſuch a one: the want of baptim, shal not hurt me: ſeing that I nether neglect it, nor contemn yt.</p>
            <p>And if he could shew, that I was not baptized: yet the caſe of rebaptization is not ſo clear, as he maketh yt. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering<note place="margin">a Euſeb. 7 lib. cap. 9.</note> that Dyoniſius the great and famous Bishop of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria, when one came vnto hym, which ſware that the baptim he receiued of the heretikes, was nothing like the catholik baptim, but ful of horrible blaſphemies, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be baptized of him, for that he was trobled in his conſcience: ſaid that <hi rend="sup">b</hi> 
               <hi>he durst not baptiz him,</hi> adding that <hi>forſomuch as he had often ſaid Amen vnto the thankes giuing in the church, and receiued the holy ſupper of the lord: that he should therevuith content, and comfort hym ſelf.</hi> Yf the Anſ. had but ſuch an autority, vncontrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of other: he would quikly shape vs owt, a definitiue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. howbeit, I ſtay not thereupon: onely I bring it, that w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch a caſe should befal, we come not vnto this remedy, withowt inquiring into the matter, and that yt be not doen vpon the D. bare word.</p>
            <p>Vuhere I alledged <hi>that the Miniſter is of the ſubſtance of the ſacrament, conſidering that it is a principal part of Chriſts inſtitution:</hi> he anſwereth, that <hi>the eſſential form, is to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7987:73"/> baptiſe in the name of the father, the Son and the holy gost: which being kept, the Sacrament remayneth, by whomſoeuer, or howſoeuer yt be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred.</hi> This he fathereth of <hi>Augustin, and Zuinglius:</hi> whereas, nether of them goeth further then to the perſon, by whome yt is miniſtred: ſo that he hath here falſified them. Beſide th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at I haue <note place="margin">pag. 521. 523.</note> shewed, that Auguſtin ſtandeth in dowt, whether baptim by a lay man, be available or no. where, by al likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he was owt of dowt, that that which was miniſtred by a woman, whoſe vnaptnes herein is dubble to that of a lay man: was of none effect. he citeth alſo M. <hi>Caluin:</hi> but vtterly to another purpoſe, then he meaneth. For where he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that the goodnes or euilnes of the Miniſter maketh not, nor marreth not the ſacrament: the D. pretendeth, as thowgh it were not to be eſtemed, whether he were a publik miniſter or no, which is a mere abuſing. For further anſwer, I refer the reader to that <note n="b" place="margin">In the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the D. cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</note> already anſwered: ſo doe I, for anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to that of <hi>Miniſters</hi> which crepe in <hi>withowt calling,</hi> vnſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably ſpoken of: likewiſe for the cauil of <hi>rebaptization.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if the reader compare the anſwers of his togither: he shal ſee, that the Anſ. him ſelf, hath clean ouerthrown his own groundes. And firſt of al this, that <hi>the being of the ſacrament hangeth onely hereof, if the form of wordes, I baptiz the in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the father &amp;c. be kept.</hi> For to proue that the being of the ſacrament, <hi>dependeth not in any reſpect of the perſon which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth</hi> yt: he alledgeth firſt, <hi>that ſo we should be alwaies in dowt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be baptized:</hi> which maketh ſtronglier againſt this, that <hi>the being of baptim dependeth of the vſing of thoſe wordes I baptiz t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he in the name of the father &amp;c.</hi> then againſt this that yt <hi>dependeth vpon a publik Minister.</hi> for al may vnderſtand, that yt is eaſier for a man to know, that he was in his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy baptized of a publik Miniſter: then to know, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter then <hi>vſed theſe wordes, I baptiz the in the name of the father &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another reaſon is, for that <hi>the force of the ſacrament is not in the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but in god him ſelf, his ſpirit, and free effectual operation:</hi> and th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereto abuſeth 1. Corinth. 3. <hi>what is Paul &amp;c.</hi> which is rather to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7987:73"/> proue, that the being of the ſacrament dependeth not of the vſing of the wordes, <hi>I baptize the in the name of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp;c.</hi> foraſmuch as S. Paul ſpeaketh there, of the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le miniſtery, whereof this is a part, wherein the D. hym ſelf placeth the being of the Sacrament. And in deed, the drift of his reaſon is, that there is no owtward thing whatſoeuer, neceſſarily required in the being of the Sacrament: which is a shameful error.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, let it be, that the vſage of theſe wordes, is the onely <hi>eſſential form:</hi> what shal be the material cauſe? For there muſt be aſwel a matter, whereof the ſacrament muſt conſiſt, as a form whereby it is: and as wel is the material cauſe of the ſacrament a ſubſtantial cauſe, as ys the form. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a thing can not ſtand withowt the form: ſo can yt not ſtand withowt the matter. Now when the one is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to the conſtitution of a thing, as the other: let him shew me, why a faut in the form, or departing from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, should more deſtroy the nature of the ſacrament, then a defaut, or departure from the matter, which is the water. And verely for my part, I would rather iudg him baptized, which is baptized into the name of Chriſt, withowt adding the father and holy goſt, when the element of water is add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: then when the other wordes being duly kept, ſome oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er liquor is vſed.</p>
            <p>This alſo is declared by his own example <hi>of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Althowgh the example otherwiſe, in my poor iudgment, be vnſound: that a man hauing the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rdes ſaid at one tyme, and the Element powred at another, should be iudged baptized. For it is as much, as if a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the bread in the church at Eaſter, and the cup at the Natiuity: should be therfore ſaid, to haue receiued the holy

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7987:75"/> the holy ſeal of baptim, to aſſurance of our conſcience, that we are washed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſynnes, we muſt haue the publik min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter. If it be ſaid, that this is to ty men to ſtreight to the owt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes, and that for ſomuch as it is Chriſt that washe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th from ſinnes, there is les matter who be the Miniſter: I anſwer, that as our Sa.

            <p>And if the wil of a Prince, doe make that onely to be his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, which he hath appointed for that purpoſe, ſo that altho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wgh another ether withowt or againſt his wil be made, of t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he ſame matter and faſchion, and in al thinges like yt, yet the ſame is none of his ſeal: how much more owght the wil of god, which is, that onely thoſe should miniſter the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which haue a publik calling thereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, haue that auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And, as by the ſeal, which the Prince hath ſet apart to ſeal his grauntes with, when it is ſtollen, and ſet to by hym that hath no autority, there groweth no aſſurance vnto the party that hath yt: ſo if it were poſsible to be the ſeal of god, which a woman should ſet to, yet for that she hath ſtollen yt, and put it to, not onely withowt, but contrary to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of god: I ſee not, how any can take any aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce by reaſon therof. If it be ſaid, that the Princes confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion afterward, maketh euen that ſtollen ſeal, which was ſet to, of force: I anſwer, that where yt can be shewed, that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim by wemen is confirmed of god, there I wil graunt the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke in yt. hetherto may be referred, the purſuit of the former compariſon. For as a priuate man, kylling a murtherer, hath hym ſelf murthered, and executed no iuſtice, becauſe he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d no calling thereunto: euen ſo, thoſe which withowt al cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling haue taken in hand to baptize, haue made a prophane washing, and miniſtred no ſacrament of the lord.</p>
            <p>That a <hi>distinction hath bene kept in names of offices, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uhen the offices the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues haue not bene diſtinguished,</hi> or at

For althowgh, there be diuers ſortes of ſendinges: yet th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Miniſter be ſent, is required of al. So that althowgh S. Paul should there draw that diſputation, vnto the ſending of the Apoſtles: yet the rule wherby he confirmeth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelship, is general. For a Paſtor can no more preach now, in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7987:76"/> a particular congregation withowt a ſending: then an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle could then, in al the world. The wordes I added, <hi>no not althovugh he ſpake the vuordes of the ſcripture,</hi> be no ſuch <hi>addition,</hi> as he ſurmiſeth: ſeing they are neceſſarily conteyned, in the Apoſtles ſentence. For when him ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth not, but that one which is not ſent, may ſpeak the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of ſcripture, and the Apoſtle ſaith, that the ſame can not preach: it foloweth, that one not ſent, althowgh he ſpeak the wordes of the ſcriptures, can not therefore be ſaid to preach.</p>
            <p>He procedeth further, ſaying <hi>that as it is the word of god w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich is preached by miniſter, or other: ſo is baptim true baptim, by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be miniſtred.</hi> as if he had already gotten, ether that w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſoeuer ſpeaketh the word preacheth yt: or that it were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready baptim, withowt the publik miniſter, boeth which are in demaund. Moreouer, if he can proue, that the washing with the element, withowt any to apply it, is a ſacrament, as the word is the word, althowgh no man handle yt, or ſpeak of yt: then I wil graunt, that which he ſaith. But if it be no Sacrament, but when it is browght into vſe, and the vſe be defined to be ſuch as is ſaid: then yt is apparant, that there is a great difference, betwene the word and ſacramentes, in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>Laſt of al, as he, which taking one part of the wordes of the ſcripture, an leauing another that should goe with yt, propoundeth not the word of god, but his own idle fancy: euen ſo, he that keepeth one principal part of the ſacramte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, leauing another behynde, miniſtreth no ſacrament of god, but a deuiſe of his own head. Now, where he would draw th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is cauſe into hatered, in that <hi>there is</hi> (as he ſayth) <hi>no learned man of this iudgment:</hi> althowgh the reaſon be weak, and yt vnmeet, that the trwth should be miſtruſted, becauſe she can fynde no ſuertishyp emongeſt men: yet, if that wil help hym, he hath M.

            <p>Seing then they onely are bidden in the ſcripture to adminiſter the Sacraments, which are bidden to preach t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he word, and that the publik Miniſters haue onely this ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arge of the word: and ſeing that the adminiſtration of boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th theſe, are ſo lincked together, that the denial of licence to doe one, is a denial to doe the other, as of the contrary part, licence to one is licence to the other: conſidering al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that to miniſter the Sacraments, is an honor in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch, which none can take vnto hym, but he which is called vnto yt as was Aaron: and further, foraſmuch as the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing by priuate perſons, and by wemen eſpecially, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the dangerous error of the condemnation of young ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ildren, which dy withowt baptim: Laſt of al, ſeing we haue the conſent of the godly learned of al tymes, againſt the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptim by wemen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the reformed churches now, againſt the baptim by priuate men: we conclude, that the adminiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this Sacrament by priuate perſons, and eſpecially by wemen, is merely boeth vnlawful and void.</p>
            <p>There remaineth another quaeſtion, whether the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes of papiſtes, are to be receiued to baptim.

For, althowgh they haue the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me wordes, yet they match this cauſe, with others which are neceſſary, and which haue certein proof owt of the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, althowgh not in expres wordes: whereas, he matcheth yt with thoſe thinges which are (by his own confeſsion) indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and not neceſſary, giuing thereby to vnderſtand, that there is no better grownd of the one, then of the other. whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch reaſon, being alledged to proue the occaſion of triumph which he giuith here vnto the Catabaptiſtes, and Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes: he anſwereth not. The three next diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are anſwered.</p>
            <p>Next vnto this foloweth another vnchangeable doctrine as yt lyeth pa. 603 of the D. book. where, althowgh the Anſw. dare not ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly vndertake the defence of driuing of known papiſtes vnto the lords ſupper: yet, partly, in trifling with the proofes browght for the shutting of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> owt, partly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in other matter of his own: priuily, and as it were vnder the ground, he maynteyneth his former rashnes, of ſaying, that the <hi>Admo. were good patrones of the papistes, for maynteining, th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at papiſtes owght not to be thruſt into the lordes ſupper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was alledged, that <hi>the ſcripture vuhich forbiddeth</hi>

For, althowgh in ſome ſignification, he were not of the church: yet he was boeth within, and as towching the owtward calling (wherof our queſtion is) of the church alſo. But vnto this I haue <note n="a" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer booK p. 168. lin. 16.</note> alredy anſwered.

For I added expresly, and that twiſe: <hi>As many as be of the church,</hi> from which I had before, shut owt the papiſtes.</p>
            <p>In that the <hi>Admo. vuil not haue men come constrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly to the holy Communion: they take not away the punishme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nt, against thoſe which owght to preſent them ſelues.</hi> And their ſaying hath an eaſier defence, then his <note n="d" place="margin">

But if (notwithſtanding that punishment) yt be manifeſtly perceiued, that they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me with no affection, but <hi>conſtreynedly:</hi> then the Adm. wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld haue ſuch put by: which is their meaning, and a iudgm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent agreable to the word of god. to the reſt in this chapter, I anſwer not.</p>
            <p>Hereunto ad that of the examination of thoſe, whoſe knowledg of the miſtery of the goſpel, is douted of: as yt ſtandeth in his book page 592. which examination, he is not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7987:80"/> affraid to deny, to be neceſſary, or commanded by the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rd of god. his firſt reaſon is, becauſe that <hi>in the Apostles tymes no ſuch would offer them ſelues:</hi> which is a manifeſt vntruth, as may be gathered of that I haue <note n="a" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part. p. 244. l. 16.</note> ſaid, and by that the <hi>ſeed of the vuord of god, is</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 13. 4</note> 
               <hi>taken ovut of the heart</hi> of diuers th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at profes the goſpel, which notwithſtanding, ether throwgh hypocriſy in deſire to be counted to haue the ſame know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg with others, or inſenſiblenes of not feeling their want, wil offer them ſelues. And if there were none ſuch then, yet forſomuch as, there be ſuch amongeſt vs: that anſwer is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, conſidering that the ſcripture conteyneth reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, not onely againſt the corruptions in the tyme of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, but in al tymes.</p>
            <p>His ſecond reaſon, <hi>that offering them ſelues ſo, it is their own on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ely faut:</hi> is a crauing of that in queſtion. For <hi>that it is onely their faut,</hi> and that <hi>the gouernours of the church haue no commandement, to look to yt:</hi> are the ſame in effect.</p>
            <p>His third reaſon, that <hi>if yt had bene ſo neceſſary, S. Paul, would haue ſpoken of yt here eſpecially,</hi> is to fond: conſidering that the Apoſtle writeth onely, ether of ſuch fautes as were in that church, or of matters whereof his iudgment was asked. That alſo owt of M. <hi>Caluin,</hi> is meerly idle. For it is one queſtion, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hether a priuate man, vnder coulor of an vnmeet perſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ſupper, owght to withdraw hym ſelf: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether ſuch a one, should be admitted by the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the church. his anſwer maketh alſo as much to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, that knowen whoremongers should not be driuen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, before they come to the communion, as knowen papiſtes: conſidering, that it belongeth not to priuate men, to take in hand the correction of them, when they preſent them ſelues.</p>
            <p>Againſt that alledged, <hi>of the commandement to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diuiſ. 3. p. 592. Cronicl. 2. 35. 6.</note> 
               <hi>to prepare the people to the receiuing of the Paſouer, vuhich vuas the ſame vuith them, that the holy ſupper is vuith vs:</hi> he excepteth, and that confidently, and with repr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oches, <hi>that it is abrogated.</hi> whoſe shameful dealing herein, let

But of this, more hath bene ſaid <note n="a" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part p. 162. lin. 10. and 220. l. 28.</note> otherwhere. After he excepteth, that <hi>the text is, that they should prepare, not examin:</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch is friuolous, and preuented, in that I added, <hi>that exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is a part of preparation.</hi> So that he that comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the whole, muſt needes doe the part: whereunto he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, but affirmeth <hi>yt manifeſt, that the Leuites vſed no ſuch exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi> of which <hi>manifeſtnes,</hi> there is not a letter in the text. The contrary, by al likelihood, is to be intended: conſideri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng, that diuers of the people, nue come owt of ignorance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd Idolatry, had need of particular trial. againſt which the <hi>marginal note</hi> maketh not: ſeing <hi>exhortation</hi> may wel ſtand with examination, and the nature of a note, is not to lay owt thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nges at large.</p>
            <p>That the papiſtes <hi>may as wel vſe this for auriculer confeſsion,</hi> is ſo placed, that yt may be taken, that the Iues vſed auricular confeſsion, as a ceremony vnder the law, which is vntrue: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd ſo yt is propounded, as if there were as good ground in the word of that, as of thys: which beſide the vntruth, is ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erturned of his own wordes, confeſsing that <note n="b" place="margin">pag. 593.</note>

Nether by matters pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto the king, are vnderſtanded thoſe which pertayn vnto his own perſon, or his family, but matters within the compas of his princely iudgment: as appeareth, by the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mple of the <hi>cauſe of blood,</hi> which the ſcripture ſetteth down,<note place="margin">verſ. 10.</note> eſpecially if this place be compared, with that of Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, where this example is put particularly, and oppoſed to the iudgment of <note n="a" place="margin">Deu. 17. 8</note> leproſy, which then belonged vnto the prieſt.</p>
            <p>To the place in the <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 5. 1.</note> Hehrues, that the high Prieſt is <hi>appointed, ouer thinges vuhich appertayn vnto god:</hi> he anſwereth, that the <hi>Apostle declareth, that thoſe thinges are to offer giftes</hi> &amp;c. which is nothing worth. For, the propoſition is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb facs="tcp:7987:83"/> wherupon the Apoſtle concludeth ſo much, as ſerued for the preſent purpoſe: otherwiſe yow may as wel ſay, that yt belonged not to the high Prieſt, to preach, becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle mentioneth not that part of his office, in that place. Seing then it is apparant, owt of the Cronicles, that iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in church matters pertayneth vnto god: Seing likewi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, it is euident owt of this teſtimony of the Apoſtle, that the high Prieſt is ſet ouer thoſe matters in gods behalf: it muſt needes folow, that the principality or direction of the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, is by gods ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce pertayning vnto the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gh Prieſt, and conſequently to the miniſtery of the church.

            <p>That which I ſaid, of <hi>Leuites vſed to the iudgment of ciu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il cauſes, for that they could not al be employed to the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istery, conſidering that, ſo there should haue bene almoste for euery xijme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Leuite:</hi> is barely denied, and nether the reaſon which I browght co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed, nether any of his ſet down. whereunto may be added the reaſon, why the Leuites not occupied in the church miniſtery: were willingly taken, for aſsiſtance in ciuil iudgmentes. which is, becauſe they being better acquainted, with the law of god, then commonly the reſt of the tribes: were conſequently better ſeen in the iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials, by which the common wealth of the Iſraelites was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned.

            <p>Before I come to the Anſ. arguments, I deſire the reader<note place="margin">Diuiſ. 3. p. 698.</note> to obſerue, that althowgh he hath owt of the auncient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, borowed certein places, to iuſt with thoſe, which I haue taken from thence: yet owt of the holy ſcripture, whereof he should haue made the baſe and foundation of his defence, he hath browght nothing. But let vs ſee them ſuch as they are. <hi>Euſebius</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>calleth Conſtantine, as yt were a general Bishop.</hi> That maketh no more to proue, that the <hi>iudgment of eccleſiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

               <hi>apointed of god to al nations,</hi> proueth hym to haue bene a publik preacher of the word. Rather, as he was called a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> becauſe that the doctrine taught by the Bishops, was maynteyned by his autority, not for that he taught him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lf: ſo he is called the general Bishop, for that he cauſed th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em to meet in Councel, protected them when they were th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere, kept them in peace, maynteyned with his princely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority, that which was godlyly decreed, not for that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the matters hym ſelf. This may alſo appear, in his epiſtle to the churches, where willing to draw credit vnto t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he decrees of that Councel, he doeth not ſay that they were his, but the <hi>Bishops decrees.</hi> And in deed yt might more iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly<note place="margin">Euſeb. 3. li. de vita Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan.</note> be concluded, that he was a miniſter of the word by the one place, then by the other, that he made eccleſiaſtical la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, of his own autority: conſidering, that the place browg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ht by him, is delaied and laid in water, by that he calleth h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im not a Bishop ſimply, but <hi>as it vuere a Bishop:</hi> where as, the other place is not ſo.</p>
            <p>And it is further to be obſerued, that the word <hi>Bishop</hi> is taken ſome tymes generally, for any ouerſeer: and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely for the church Miniſter. In which reſpect, Conſtanty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne calleth him ſelf a Bishop, but putteth a manifeſt differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, betwene his Bishoprik and theirs: namely, that the c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurch officers were Bishops and ouerſeers <hi>of thinges vuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hin</hi>

               <hi>the church, and he, Bishop or ouerſeer of thoſe that v<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uere vuithovut the church.</hi> whereby he clearly alſo eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisheth, the diſtinction of the church and common weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th vnder a Chriſtian Prince.

<pb facs="tcp:7987:84"/> further affirmeth, that the <hi>common vuealth matters onely belonged vnto them.</hi> Likewiſe that Ambroſe ſaith: <hi>That Palaces belong vnto the Emperour, but the churches</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amb. lib. 5. Epist. 33.</note> 
               <hi>vnto the Minister: and that he had autority of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vualles of the city, and not ouer holy thinges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That of <hi>Conſtantyne,</hi> and after of <hi>Iuſtinian, making lawes tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching godlines, as againſt the worship of Images &amp;c.</hi> is idle, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is nothing but an execution of that, which is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mmanded of god, and withowt the compas of thinges, wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich fal into the church is conſultation. For in thinges, which he is aſſured of, to be the vnuariable truth of god: who dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth but that he not onely may, but owght alſo to mayntein them, with his autority. Sauing that, if there be a general do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wt raiſed, what is the law of god therein: to the end that the the truth may haue better cours, and that the conſcience may be prouided for, there is herein great caution to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For leaſt that which is godly, should be doe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vngodlily, that is to ſay ignorantly or doutfully, and to the end that t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he autors of error (being conuinced) may doe les hurt, and finally to the end that the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the obſtinate, may be boeth more iuſt, and les grudged at: yt belongeth vnto the ciuil Magiſtrate, to cal (as did the godly Emperour Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine) a councel of the miniſtery, by whome, as by gods interpreters, the people may receiu a reſolution, warranted by ſubſtantial groundes owt of hys word.</p>
            <p>Yet ſo far it is, that we ſuſpend vpon the Councels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, the putting in execution of ſuch as he is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be the vnchangeable commaundementes of god: th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at boeth before, in, and after the Councel, yea and howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they determin, we eſteme that the Prince owght to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by al godly and conuenient meanes, that ſuch lawes of god haue place: at the leaſt that the contrary be not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, not ſo much as (if it might be) one onely hower.</p>
            <p>That owt of the <hi>Chalcedon councel, that the orders there made were by the Emperours autority, becauſe they cried long life vnto the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and Emperour:</hi> is vnſufficient. For, althowgh it was vnme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, that in ſuch graue meetinges, there should be vſed ſuch

For it might haue more colour, if yow had ſaid, that it were <hi>modeſty</hi> for a Bishop to ſay: that to adminiſter the word and ſacramentes belong not to hym, but vnto the Prince. Beſide that, yf he would haue shewed forth <hi>modeſty:</hi> he would haue rather ſaid, that he was not worthy, then to ſay <hi>that it vuas not lavuful for him to doe yt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To that, <hi>that the Emperour vuould not determin of Arius hereſy, but committed yt to the Synod:</hi> he anſweret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>h, that yt <hi>letteth not but that he had autority, ſauing that, therby he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed his wiſdome, in committing matters of doctrine to them, which are moste fit to entreat of them.</hi> A ſtraunge kinde of wiſdome, to put
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7987:85"/> ouer that which belonged vnto his office, to them to who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe office that did not belong: verely this is not the wiſdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, which commeth from aboue. For althowgh it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a Prince, to diſcharge part of his burthen vpon ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers, for the more commodity of his ſubiectes: yet, if this belong vnto him, as he is appointed of god the ciuil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, he can not put yt vnto any other, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto a ciuil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, as I haue <note n="a" place="margin">Tract. 7.</note> before shewed.</p>
            <p>Here alſo, I would ask of him, how the Councel of Nice was fitter to iudg of the matter, then the Emperour? was it by ſome ſinguler caſe, or by reaſon of their office of being Bishops? Yf (as needes he muſt) he anſwer, that th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey are by calling and by office, fitter to iudg of ſuch cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: how muſt not that pertein vnto them, which are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by calling, the fitteſt Iudges. For, althowgh there be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und ſometymes, ſome ciuil gouernour which hath more s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kil to iudg in church matters, then ſome Bishop, as alſo ſome Bishops to haue more skil in common wealth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then ſome ciuil gouernour: yet notwithſtanding, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one, nor the other hath this kunning, by any gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ft incident into his office which he exerciſeth. So that, the Anſwerer, in reputing it, <hi>for wiſdome in the Emperour, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit theſe matters vnto the Bishops, as vnto the most able Iudges,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a deep wound in the wiſdome of god, whileſt he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, that god hath committed that to be doen by the Magiſtrate, whereof, by office, he is not the fitteſt doer: w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich is a voice, vnworthy of a very ſukling, much more, of a D. in diuinity. And, that this is moſt properly belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging<note place="margin">1. Tit.</note> vnto a Bishop, it appeareth, in that the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, that he <hi>should be able to conuince the gainſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers:</hi> which he neuer required of the ciuil Magiſtrate: and notwithſtanding would haue required yt, if the deciſion of ſuch cauſes, had apperteyned vnto him. For the lord, calle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th no man to any thing: of whome he requireth not giftes, meet to furnish his calling.</p>
            <p>Not vnlike to this reaſon, is that in the 5. diuiſion pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7987:85"/> 701, which is: <hi>that for ſo much as the Ministers, are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte able to decide of church matters, that therfore, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion belongeth vnto them.</hi> whereunto he anſwereth firſt, <hi>that it is Hardings reaſon,</hi> but sheweth not, where it is to be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und: where I alledging it, as his own reaſon, pointed hym the place, wherunto he anſwereth not a word. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſaith, that <hi>yt proueth onely, that it is most conuenient and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the ministers, while they be godly and learned, may haue the deciding of matters in religion.</hi> Here, if the Anſw. had not fum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and faultered in his ſpeach: we had had hym, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither, yet very nigh conſenting with vs. therefore, let the reader note, that whereas he hath borowed boeth his anſwers, and al his auncient autorities from the Bishop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd M.

               <hi>they should decide theſe matters, that the Prince is commanded to haue recours vnto them in dovutful mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that it belongeth to the Bishops office to decide of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch cauſes: but that Christian Princes, haue rather to doe vuith theſe matters, then ignorant and vuicked Prieſtes,</hi> and that <hi>in caſe of neceſsity</hi> (meaning when the miniſtery is wicked) the <hi>Prince ovught to prouide for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t remedy:</hi> the very ſelf ſame thing, which we maynteyn, in ſaying, <hi>vuhen there is no lavuful ministery, that then the Prince ovught, to take order in theſe thinges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, becauſe he diſſenting from them, would yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to be at one, he alſo hath ſet down, <hi>that it is neceſsary:</hi> but how? mark I pray yow, and yow shal ſee that, in ſtryui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng againſt a manifeſt truth, he became ſpeachles. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth <hi>it is neceſſary, that they may decide:</hi> he durſt not ſay
<pb facs="tcp:7987:86"/> that it is neceſſary they should, but that <hi>they may decide.</hi> where in ſaying that <hi>it is neceſſary,</hi> he leaueth no choiſe: again, in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying <hi>that they may,</hi> he deſtroyeth the neceſsity, which he had before put, leauing it in the Princis power, whether they s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal or no. Thus as the <hi>mous kleauing fast in the pitchbox,</hi> in one ſentence: he affirmeth that a godly and learned mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, muſt of neceſsity, and not of neceſsity, decide of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe cauſes.</p>
            <p>That which he addeth, that <hi>the autority doeth as wel stil rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in the Prince, when the Miniſters decide, as when the Iudges determin of ciuil cauſes:</hi> is vntrw. Yf, as he pretendeth, it were at the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis chois, whether a godly myniſtery, should decide of th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em or no, then yt were true he ſaith: but if it be true, which the Bishop and M. Nowel ſay, that yt is neceſſary, that a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly miniſtery should decide of them, and that yt belongeth to the the Bishops office ſo to doe: then the compariſon, is moſt vnequal. For the iudgment of ciuil cauſes, doeth ſo be long vnto the Magiſtrate, that he is not bound by the law of god, to translate yt vnto other. Nay the law of god, wil haue, that Princes them ſelues (ſo far as they may, and are able) shal bear their dominion vpon their own shoulders, and iudg the cauſes of their ſubiectes in their own perſons: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that the ſcripture calleth al princes, Iudges, and ſetteth euery one a Throne, to iudg the cauſes of his peop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le. Now (to return bak, where I leaft) foloweth his anſwer to the Councel of Conſtantinople: <hi>that it is to late a testimony, being other in the year 549 or</hi> 681. which might haue place in this caſe, where the queſtion is of the Bishopes iuriſdiction, as that which in proces of tyme did owtreach: were it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, by other teſtimonies of the former age. In the firſt of which Councels, Menna the Patriark being preſident, it is ſaid that the decree of the Bishopes <hi>firm in yt ſelf, vuas co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Emperour.</hi> Now ſeing the Bishops, had then this autority: how much more, by his own confeſsion, had they the ſame, in the other which was later. And the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me <hi>Conſtantine</hi> which the D. ſpeaketh of, giueth more to the Bishopes, then we doe: namely that he <hi>vuould compel none
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7987:86"/> to the truth, oneles they concluded ſomething.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That yt was ſaid, that the <hi>Emperour confirmed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Councel, and not that the Emperour made the decrees:</hi> ſerueth alſo wel for <hi>this purpoſe.</hi> For, if ether he had made them, or they had bene made vnder his name: they should haue bene ſaid, to haue bene made by him: as decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es made by the Princis deputies, are ſaid to be made by the Prince.</p>
            <p>That which he addeth, of the <hi>Emperour being moderator of the Councel,</hi> beſide that yt proueth not his cauſe, conſidering that the Moderator had not al the autority: it is vntrue, and contrary to the practis of Councels in al tymes: oneles by moderatorship, he mean the appointing of the tyme of the Councels aſſembly and diſmiſsion, the houers of their ſitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng, the ciuil punishment of them which behaue them ſelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es tumultuously, or otherwiſe diſorderly. If he doe, it is that which we willingly graunt: but, which maketh nothing for this purpoſe.</p>

               <hi>haue a church matter before the Emperour <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alentinian,</hi> firſt, he anſwereth <hi>that he was young:</hi> as thowgh his tender yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, could diminish his right: or that a Prince of 18 or 20 yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res ould, had not as ample autority as one of 40. Secondly, that he <hi>was not baptized:</hi> which was not, for that he refuſed ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptim, but becauſe the maner then was not to baptiz, before the hower of death was ſuppoſed to approch. For, the Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ns them ſelues, doe not pretend any enmity, or refuſal of baptim. And howſoeuer ſome haue alledged yt, yow might haue bene ashamed to alledg yt: which before, affirmed th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at<note place="margin">pag. 146.</note> Ambroſe was <hi>meet to be choſen Bishop, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that he we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt exception is, that <hi>he was an Arian heretik: ſo that no equal iudgment, was to be hoped for at his hand.</hi> which is no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent anſwer: conſidering that Ambroſe denieth the Empero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ur the determination of the cauſe, not for that he was a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Emperour, but becauſe it was not <hi>red in ſcripture, nor
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7987:87"/> heard of before, that any Emperour,</hi> (and therfore nether godly nor vngodly) was Iudg <hi>ouer a Bishop, in a cauſe of faith.</hi> which was not his iudgment onely, but the iudgment of other Bishops round abowt. Therefore, it is vntru, <hi>that Ambroſe ſtayed him ſelf chiefly, of a priuiledg graunted by Theodoſius:</hi> not onely, for that it was not lawful for Theodoſius, to haue paſſed the right of the ciuil Magiſtrate, to the Bishops: but becauſe Ambroſe fetched his defence, from the ſcripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd auncienter tymes, then was Theodoſius priuiledg. Beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de that, if Theodoſius had graunted that to the Bishops, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich belonged vnto hym: his heir could be no more bound by his graunt herein, then the committing of ciuil iudgm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes vnto them, should haue hindred him to cal them bak again, into his own hand. So that, when Valentinian had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he would haue the hearing of the matter hym ſelf: that could not be, any iuſt defence.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, if it belong vnto the ciuil Magiſtrate, to iudg in cauſes eccleſiaſtical, no abuſe or diſorder of his, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue hym of yt, ſo long as he remayneth in the ful eſtate of a Prince: no more then men can take away from him, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght of iudgment in ciuil cauſes, and erect another court a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his, becauſe he peruerteth iudgment, ether by giftes or fauour. Therefore, if it be true that the D. houldeth, that this right belongeth to Ceſar: Ambroſe owght to haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and to haue waited, what the Emperours iudgment would haue bene. If it had bene againſt the truth, then to haue anſwered as the Apoſtles to the Councel, <hi>that he vuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld</hi>

            <p>Again, yt is known, that the Prieſtes and Prophetes haue extraordinarily meddled with ciuil affaires, in confuſed ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: wil he therfore ſay, that this power is ordinarily anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed vnto the Bishops office. The caſes, I graunt, are not alt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogither like: yet to his queſtion, which ſuppoſeth that <hi>there is no cauſe, why the Magiſtrate should not iudg of church matters, aſwel when there is a lawful miniſtery, as when there is none:</hi> this may ſerue, for part of an anſwer.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, as in ſiknes, there is another diet, then in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alth: ſo the church in her greuous diſeas, hath an other kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of gouernment, then that which is ordinary, and vſed in a good conſtitution of her body. which thing, being ſaid of the ruinous eſtate of the church, is to be vnderſtood alſo, of her beginninges and, as yt were, infancy: where ether there was no church before, or hauing bene, yt was raſed from the foundations. Yf this content him not: let him anſwer me, why the Prince muſt of <hi>neceſsity, commit theſe matters to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery when it is learned and godly, rather then when yt is otherwiſe:</hi> if, at the leaſt, he wil now at the laſt, haue this the meaning of this broken english. And of his anſwer, to this queſtion, wil eaſely riſe an anſwer to his.</p>
            <p>But ſome sharper Aduerſary, might here haue obiected: that Moſes, Dauid, and Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being Princes in the moſte florishing eſtate of the church: did notwithſtanding make church orders. whereunto I anſwer, that they did ſo, partly, for that they were not kinges onely and Princes, but alſo Prophetes of god: partly, for that they had ſpecial and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres direction therto, from god by the prophete: whereby they did euen thoſe thinges in the church, which, withowt ſuch ſpecial reuelation, was not lawful, for the Prieſtes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to haue doe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And althowgh, the truth of this anſwer, be apparant: yet, that it may haue the more autority, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with the D. that taſteth nothing withowt this ſauce: he may vnderſtand, that it is M. Caluins anſwer of Moſes, and Dauid, and that in this preſent cauſe now debated.<note place="margin">Lib. epiſtol. Gal. pa. 46</note>
            </p>
            <p>His other quarrel againſt this anſwer is, that <hi>if a lawful mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery determining ſome thing vnlawful, wil not be browght to that which is iust, that then the Prince must haue ether that which they wil, or
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7987:89"/> no religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> As thowgh, ſuch a miniſtery were a lawful miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that is obſtinate. or as if, this obſtinacy being general or for the moſte part, the ſtate is not here ruinous: ſo that the Prince may, after due meanes, aſſaied to bring them home, procure that other be put in their places. we herby appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the <hi>remedy of this inconuenience,</hi> which (he ſaith) <hi>he can not ſee:</hi> was comprehended, in the firſt part of the ſecond dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, betwene ours, and the Papiſts iudgment.</p>
            <p>But, if for that, a lawful miniſtery is ſubiect to error, or doeth er in the deciſion of eccleſiaſtical cauſes, he think that yt should not therefore handle theſe matters: he may as wel take from them, the preaching of the word: conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that an error, may as wel be found in the pulpit, as in the Councel hows. And look what remedy the Magiſtrate hath againſt a miniſtery, teaching falsly or inconueniently in the pulpit: the ſame hath he againſt yt, determining ſo in Councel.</p>
            <p>And, to make the partition wal, betwene the papiſtes and vs in this queſtion, one cubite higher, that thoſe which wil not open their eys to ſee it, may feel yt, in not onely ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but running alſo their heades againſt yt: I wil ad this muche, that in aſcribing vnto the miniſtery, the deciſion of matters in controuerſy, and the making of church ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: our meaning is not vtterly to ſeclude the Magiſtrate.

For, if honeſt matrones haue re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gard, to the ſmaleſt part of the attire of th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eir daughters, that yt be nether sluttish, nor gawish, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the maner of harlots: much more, owght that care to be taken for the church of god, that by her comely and maide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nlike apparel, she may content eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eyes of al, which lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue her ſpiritual chaſtity.

            <p>For the mayntenance of this reaſon, that <hi>the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>

               <hi>in ceremonies conformed the Gentiles vnto the Iues, and not contrarivuiſe, the Iues vnto the Gentiles, and therfore, that the churches in the matter of ceremonies, should be inſtituted rather according to the patern of the churches dreſſed vp before them, then of the popish ſinagog:</hi> I refer the reader, to that I haue <note n="c" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part p. 470.</note> already written. That <hi>the lord, forbad his people to doe ſome thinges, vuhich in them ſelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es vuere lavuful:</hi> is manifeſt in the <note n="d" place="margin">Leuit. 19. 19. 27.</note> law. That <hi>he hath shewed, that the Chriſtians haue conformed them ſelues vnto Idolaters in their ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch ceremonyes, with approbation ether of the word, or of Augustin,</hi> is vntrue: onely he shewed, that the vſe of thinges neceſſary, owght not to be taken away for the abuſe: which he boeth oft, and idly repeateth, as that which is confeſſed.</p>
            <p>Vuhere I shewed, that the <hi>lord being careful, to ſeuer</hi>

               <hi>his people by ceremonies from al straungers: vuas ſo eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to ſeuer them from the Egiptians and Cananeans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest vuhome they liued, and amongest vuhome they</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:7987:92"/> 
               <hi>vuent to liue:</hi> he anſwereth, <hi>that the Egiptians nether worshipped, nor pretended the true god, but the papiſtes doe,</hi> which is <note n="a" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part p. 184. &amp;c.</note> before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: <hi>that the Gentiles, had like ceremonies &amp;c.</hi> which is alſo <note n="b" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part p. 470.</note> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: <hi>that hauing certein ceremonies common, with thoſe from who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me we differ wholy in ſubſtance of religion, we may much more haue the ſame with the papiſtes, from whom we differ but in certeyn ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tial po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intes.</hi> The one part whereof, is anſwered: the other (to take yt in the beſt ſens a man can expound yt) is vntrue. For the Turkes beleue one god, and ſo doe we: and therefore, we differ not in al ſubſtantial pointes, from them. And althow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gh popery houldeth diuers thinges, better then they: yet t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he Turkes hould ſome thinges, better then yt.</p>
            <p>Vuhere I affirm yt, <hi>more ſafe for vs to conform our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ceremonies to the Turkes, vuhich are far of, then to the papiſtes vuhich are ſo near,</hi> he chargeth me, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reproches, boeth here and otherwhere: but the reaſons in this diuiſion, wherof one is, <hi>that the lord vſed the ſame vuiſdome to vuardes his people, another, that there is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fear of infection from thoſe vuhich are near, then from thoſe vuhich are further of,</hi> he toucheth not. As for his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that <hi>the Turk is a profeſſed enemy vnto Christ and his name, the Po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pe pretending the contrary:</hi> the firſt is not altogither, and in al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes, true. For the Turk, acknowledgeth our Sauior Chr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt a prophet, and giueth the true Chriſtians more reſt vnder hym, then the papiſtes doe vnder them: Nether can the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the name of Chriſt, when the effect is contrary, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish the Popes faut: ſeing beſide the enmity againſt Ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, the ſyn is rather increaſed by his hypocriſy. Howbeit, I wil not here diſpute, whether the Turkes or papiſtes are gr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eater enemies: yt is enowgh, that they are boeth fallen from Chriſt, the one by errors in the head pointes of his perſon, the other by errors in the head pointes of his office: in whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch reſpect, as boeth their ceremo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ies are to be auoided, ſo in that the papiſtes are nearer vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Turkes, theirs are mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re to be avoided, then thoſe of the Turkes. That <hi>we doe not in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7987:93"/> any kinde of ceremonies, conform our ſelues to the papiſtes:</hi> requireth no confutation, as that for the proof whereof, the Anſ. muſt put owt the eyes, and ſtop the eares, of al. The reſt, of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ls pretence of Chriſtian liberty, is <note n="a" place="margin">pag. 256. 257. 258. al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo in the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part of this booK p. 403. lin. 29</note> before confuted.</p>

               <note n="b" place="margin">Diu. 4. p. 476.</note> To that, <hi>that contraries are cured by contraries, and t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat as to establish Chriſts doctrine and diſcipline, yt is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to abolish the popish doctrine and gouernment, ſo to heal the infection crept in by the popish order of ſeruice, yt is meet that an other vuere put in place:</hi> he anſwereth, that <hi>as in doctrine and diſcipline, they haue ſome good, ſo in ceremonies.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein, he toucheth not the point of my reaſon. For the cauſe why, that good which is in Popery of the doctrine and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, can not be changed, is, for that they are perpetual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, in whoſe places, no other can come: but the ceremonies we ſpeak of, are changeable, ſo that if ether bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or but as good as they can be ordeyned, yt is manifeſt, that for the cauſe aſsigned, thoſe abuſed in popery, owght to giue place. Again, whatſoeuer good they haue, ether in doctrine or in diſcipline: yt is none of theirs, but the churc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>h is. Therefore by his anſwer, as no popish doctrine or diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, is fit for the church of Chriſt: ſo are no ceremonies, b<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowght in by popery. And in deed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ordinance of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient church ceremonies, procedeth of the light and kn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owledg of the word: there being ſuch darknes and ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in Popery, yt is maruail, if yt could shape owt one conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ceremony for the church of Chriſt. The ſecond ſectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this diuiſion, is not to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>To that I alledged, of <hi>the vuay to bring a man from his</hi>

For, to <hi>ceas fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> labors the ſame dayes they did:</hi> was not ſimply vnlawful.

This alſo, may be vnderſtood, by the oppoſition he maketh, of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. for, ſeing Tert. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth not the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles, for that they worshipped not god with the Chriſtians, but for that they would not admit the ceremonies, of a religion contrary to their own: to make the oppoſition anſwerable, we muſt nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſay, that he rebuketh the Chriſtians, for that they vſed the ceremonies of a religion, contrary to that they approu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For further knowledg, of Tertullians iudgment herein: I refer the reader, to that <note n="a" place="margin">In the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt booK and firſt Tracta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te.

            <p>To that of <note n="b" place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 3. cap. 17. Socra. lib. 1. cap. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tin, diſalovuing for diuers cauſes, that the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hould hould the feast of Easter, at that tyme vu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich the Iues did:</hi> he ſaith, that the <hi>Eaſt partes kept yt, as the Iues:</hi> which is no anſwer ſeing he sheweth not, whether he alow of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantines iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or no. his ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d anſwer, that he mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>we should haue nothing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with them, repugnant to Chriſtian liberty:</hi> is vntrue, ſeing in it ſelf, there was nothing more free, then whether a feaſt should be kept vpon thursday, or ſonday.</p>
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:7987:94"/>
            <p>His third reaſon, that <hi>if he had generally misliked their ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, he would haue abrogated them,</hi> cleaueth not togither. In ſteed wherof, he should haue ſaid, yf he had vtterly misliked cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not <hi>their ceremonies.</hi> For as for theirs, he abrogated them: not onely in propounding another end, then they d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id, but alſo in diſanulling a number of ceremonies, vſed in the keping thereof. At the leaſt, this example teacheth, that if we wil hould holydayes and fishdayes, with the papiſtes: yet in deteſtation of their religion, and for avoiding of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, which hath crept into mens mindes by them, we owght to change the dayes.</p>
            <p>His laſt anſwer, that <hi>as Conſtantyn changing the day, and kep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the feast, put a difference betwene the Iues and Christians, ſo we gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly differ, from the papistes in the ceremonies taken from them:</hi> ys like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inſufficient. For althowgh that the Chriſtians, had kept the ſame day with the Iues: yet their keping of the Eaſter, s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould haue differed from the Iues keping, as much as we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffer now from the papiſtes, in the ceremonies we haue from them. But, they thowght yt not enowgh, to differ from the Iues, in thinges meerly vnlawful: onles they were alſo ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from them, by a ceremony, which was in it ſelf moſte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</p>

For, what can be in yt ſelf more indifferent, th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en theſe two, forbidden the Chriſtians: for that they were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, of the enemies of the church. And being a reaſon, yt muſt be general of al ſuch as the church may wel want: mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch more of thoſe, in place wherof, it may haue as good, or better. As for your often repeating, that the ceremonies in queſtion are <hi>godly, comely &amp; decent:</hi> yt is your ouldwont, of de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunding the thing in queſtion, and an vndowted argument of your extreme pouerty. That I cyted owt of the <hi>Councel
<pb facs="tcp:7987:94"/> of Braccaras</hi> is to <hi>be found in the councel and Tome I alledged</hi> Can. 74.

Howbeit, yt is<note place="margin">pag. 277. et diuiſ. 6.</note> further ſaid, <hi>that the offence may be taken away by preaching:</hi> but yt, was alſo replied, that yt is not ſo conuenient, that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, hauing ſo many neceſſary pointes to beſtow their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in, should be driuen to ſpend it, in giuing warning of n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot abuſing them, of which (althowgh they were vſed at the beſt) there is no profit. whereunto, his anſwer (that the <hi>abuſe of meates, and costly apparel for Princes &amp;c. doeth not take away the vſe</hi>) being of thinges, wherof there appeareth a manifeſt profit: is partly <note n="d" place="margin">In this ch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>apter.</note> before, and further commeth to be anſwered, in the diduction of the particulers.

And not content here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, the very ſame iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which he here aloweth in hym ſelf: in me he flatly condemneth afterward. For where in his former book page 174, he confeſſeth <hi>that god gaue liberty to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſix dayes:</hi> in this, he affirmeth, that by making <hi>certeyn fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes,</hi> whereof ſome fal vpon theſe ſix working dayes, <hi>he hath taken away that liberty.</hi> I ſay not a iot more, in effect: yet my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying is <hi>nue,</hi> and his is ould: I am <hi>ouershot,</hi> and he hath hit the mark. His reaſon is, becauſe I make god <hi>contrary to hym ſelf.</hi> But how I, more then he? o haue <hi>liberty of god to work ſix dayes,</hi> and to <hi>be reſtrayned by him of that liberty:</hi> be as contrary, as any thing which I haue ſet down. And of hym, it is ſaid alſo blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ntly, withowt any caution: whereas, I shewed the equity of god in this colour of contrariety. Againſt which, hys exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, that <hi>yt can not be shewed in al the ſcripture, that god hath made any law against his own commandement:</hi> ys vntrue. For not to goe far, was it not a law of god, that the Iues were bound of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity, to keep the Sabbats, and other ſolemn feaſtes? And, is yt not now a law of god, that (at the leaſt) they are not ſo bound? His fear, that god <hi>should be thus contrary to hym ſelf,</hi> is cauſeles: no more, then the father is to be houlden vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, which when his ſon commeth to mans eſtate, freeth hym of the obedience vnto his ſeruant, vnder which he caſt hym in hys tender yeares: or then the phyſition, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtate of his pacients body, preſcribeth not<note place="margin">Cal. 4.</note> onely a diuers, but a quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary diet. This ys a catechiſm matter, whereat he could hardly haue ſtumbled, yf his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y had bene ſimple: althowgh, to ſay the truth, in this caſe in

For thereby, not onely the queſtion yt ſelf: but more alſo then ys in queſtion, is demaunded.</p>
                  <p>That thoſe to whome the eſtablishing of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies doeth belong, <hi>may appoint that which is conuenient for diuine ſeruice,</hi> as often as the church may conueniently aſſemble, ys agreed: and euen in the matter of appointing whole ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dayes, in certeyn caſes, yt is alſo by me <note n="a" place="margin">

But, that the <hi>Magistrate may cal from, or compel to bodily labour, as shal be thowght to hym most conuenient:</hi> ys not meaſured, according to the cubit of the ſanctuary: I mean, of the word of god. For, what yf the Magiſtrate shal think yt conuenient, that men should labour, but one day in the week: what yf he sh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ould think neuer a one: is the Subiectes obedience tyed to this ordinance?

For, thereby he accounteth bodily labour a carnal<note place="margin">Tract. 7. p. 757.</note> liberty, which is an acceptable ſeruice vnto god: as hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne alledged, where he fel at the very ſame ſtone. whereas, yf <hi>bodily labour were carnal liberty:</hi> the church, and the Magiſtrate not onely <hi>might,</hi> but were ſtreightly bownd to <hi>restrayn yt:</hi> yea vtterly to abolish yt.</p>

                  <p>And, althowgh the wealth of ſome may wel ſuffer, al the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe

As for thoſe, to whom the lord hath giuen the meanes, to occupie them ſelues oftener, in priuate reading of the holy ſcripture, and prayer, yf they haue affection thereunto, they wil likely doe yt, withowt this order: if they haue none, they wil abuſe the reſt, to fulfil their nawghty deſires: which mig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ht be in part reſtrayned, by trauail in their vocation.<note place="margin">Diuiſ. 5. pa. 541.</note>

                  <p>The <hi>reaſon,</hi> is like.

For, as the commandement of reſting the ſeuenth day, muſt, beca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe of gods autoritye, abide in the nature of a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo the permiſsion to work the ſix dayes, warranted by the ſame autority, muſt abide in the nature of a permiſsion.

Secondly, that which was doen there: was doen, by a ſpecial direction of the ſpirit of god, ether throwgh the miniſtery
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7987:103"/> of the Prophetes which they had, or by ſome other extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes, which is not to be folowed of vs. This may appear by another <note n="a" place="margin">Zach. 8.</note> place, where the Iues changed their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes into feaſtes: onely by the mouth of the lord, throwgh the miniſtery of the Prophet. For further proof whereof, firſt I take the 28 verſe: where yt appeareth, that this was an order to endure alwayes, euen as long as the other feaſtes dayes, which were inſtituted by the lord hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelf. So that, what abuſes ſo euer were of that feaſt, yet as a perpetual decree of god, yt owght to haue remained. whereas our churches, can make no ſuch decree, which may not, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> change of tymes and other circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, be altered. For the other proof he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, I take the laſt vers. For the Prophet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenteth not hym ſelf with that, that he had rehearſed the decree, as he doeth ſometyme the decree of prophane kynges: but addeth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, that as ſone as euer the decree was made, yt was regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in this book of Eſther, which is one of the bookes of the canonical ſcripture: declaring thereby, in what eſteme they had yt. Yf yt had bene of no further autority, then our decrees, or then a canon of one of the councels: yt had bene preſumption, to haue browght yt into the library, of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goſt. The ſum of my anſwer, is, that this decree was diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and not eccleſiaſtical onely.

                     <hi>men beleue, that they are instituted to their honour:</hi> let the reader iudg, of that which I <note n="a" place="margin">In the firſt booK. p. 61. ſect. 3. &amp; 4. and pa. 62. ſect. 1. 2. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part of this p. 408. lin. 37.</note> haue written. How mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch more, doe they confirm this: when boeth the corrupt cuſtome, and doctrine, in popery, hath foreſtalled the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples mindes with that opinion. whereunto his anſwer, <hi>that I might much better reaſon against the names of Sonday and Moneday:</hi> ys vntrue. For firſt, the vſe of ſuch thinges, is not ſo free in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical matters: as in ciuil affaires. Secondly, our people hath not bene nusled vp, in that filth of worshipping the Sun and Mone, as they haue bene of the ſaintes: in ſo much as (the learned ſet apart) there are few, which know that th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere were euer any dayes, obſerued in the honour of the Sun or Mone.

                  <p>To my reaſon, that <hi>as the lordes holy dayes, are taken to be instituted to his honour, ſo the ſaintes holy dayes may eaſely be thovught of the ruder ſort, to be instituted to their honour:</hi> he anſwereth, that the lords holy dayes, <hi>are ſo called eſpecially, becauſe the ſcriptures concerning hym, are then red:</hi> which is no anſwer. For, yf hys anſwer were true: yet, yt confeſsing by the way, that they are taken in part, to be inſtituted to the lords honour, grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth forthwith, that there ys occaſion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the ruder ſort, to think that the Saintes dayes are in part, inſtituted to their honour.

<pb facs="tcp:7987:104"/> 
                     <hi>of Auguſtin,</hi> yt ys a meer abuſing of the tyme: as yf euery thing inſtituted to the honour of god, <hi>were a ſacrament,</hi> or that a thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng doen in remembrance of the lord, may not, or rather ys not, doe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hys honour. And here, yt is to be noted, that the D. ys taken, in hys own nettes. For he defendeth the keping holy, of theſe Saintes dayes, as they were vſed in the elder churches, and as Ierome and Auguſtin mayntein the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now, hym ſelf, hath for hys defence alledged owt of Ierome,<note place="margin">pag. 546.</note> that theſe dayes are <hi>obſerued to the Martyrs:</hi> and owt of Auguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that in them <hi>we honour the memoryes of martyrs.</hi> Therefore hys eſcape, that <hi>no man ys ſo mad,</hi> as to think, that <hi>by theſe dayes we doe any honour vnto the Saintes:</hi> ys not onely an ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vntruth, but directly contrary to that hym ſelf maynteyneth.</p>

Likewiſe, S. <hi>Mathew 24 where the Iues are bidden to pray, that their flight be not in winter:</hi> which is of a certeyn, and determined calamity, and that of a whole nation: in which caſe, I confeſſed that there owght to be prayers.

The ſame reaſon, I alledg afterward pag. 536, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the particuler thankes giuing at the churching of we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: whereunto he anſwereth, <hi>that there owght to be for this eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, becauſe yt is ſo dangerous and common:</hi> yet yt is not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as ſiknes, which, throwgh diſobedience, befalleth to men and wemen boeth, nor <hi>ſo dangerous,</hi> as a number of diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſes owt of which one doeth not ſo likely eſcape, as wemen owt of their trauail: beſide that the reſtoring of ſome to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alth, towcheth the church nearer oftentymes, then this. As for his asking after <hi>ſcripture,</hi> not able to anſwer the reaſons, grounded vpon the ſcripture: yt is vnworthy the anſwering. In the example of the Maſsilian heretikes, that held that we should alwayes pray: he doeth but abuſe the tyme, talking much, but not towching the point wherefore I alledged yt. let vs therefore return.</p>
                  <p>I alledged, that <hi>the original of the Let any, brovught in</hi>

                     <hi>vpon occaſion of ſome general mortality, likevuiſe of certe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in confeſsions of the diuinity of our Sau. Chriſt, vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the detestable hereſy of Arius: ovught, tovuching the ordinary vſe of the church, to ceas vuhen thoſe euils vuere appeaſed.</hi> whereunto he anſwereth, that <hi>we are ſtil ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to theſe miſcheifes:</hi> So were the elder churches, before thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:7987:109"/> euiles came, and al other churches now, as wel as ours: yet, nether did the elder churches, then inſtitute an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary remedy before the miſcheif, nether doe other church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es now, continue yt after recouery. And in deed herein, yt is with the church of god, as with mans body: whereunto no wiſe phyſicion, preſcribeth an extraordinary diet, but vpon ſome diſeas preſent, or apparantly approching: other wiſe, why are not there alſo extraordinary confeſsions, and leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes, againſt al other deteſtable hereſies, and heauy iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, which haue bene from the beginning of the world, vnto thys day.</p>
                  <p>He anſwereth further, that ſo <hi>the pſalme; made vpon ſpecial oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, should be now vnprofitable,</hi> which is nothing ſo: for they haue alwaies the ſame profit, to be ſtudied in, to be red, and preached vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which other ſcriptures haue: and this for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage aboue the reſt, that they are to be ſung, as their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me doeth declare. But to make dayly prayers of them hand ouer head, or otherwiſe then the preſent eſtate wherein we be, doeth agree with the matter conteyned in them: ys an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing of them. For how inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient ys yt, that our church, liuing vnder a godly Prince, should in ſted of a prayer for yt ſelf: ſay a pſalm, which complayneth of oppreſsion by a Tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Yea, when the eſtate of the churches should be ſuch, as the pſalm doeth expres: yet, conſidering that the prayers in the churches, owght to be framed to the vnderſtanding of the moſte ſimpleſt, and the pſalmes haue maners of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which the learned them ſelues, haue enowgh to doe to vnderſtand: yt is manifeſt, that they are not the apteſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, of publik prayer. That of the repetition, of <hi>the articles of our belief,</hi> is alledged to no purpoſe. For, yt is a short Sum of the whole Chriſtian profeſsion, directed againſt no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar hereſy: but alike needful, at al tymes.</p>
                  <p>To proue, that <hi>gloria patri &amp;c may be oft repeated, at one mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:</hi> he anſwereth, that <hi>a good thing can not be to oft ſaid.</hi> which, that I abyde in the former ſimilitude: is as much to ſay, th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at a man can not take to many purgations: And yf yt be ſo, as he ſaith, why is there any other thanckes giuing, then
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7987:109"/> this. His reaſon, that <hi>yt is a good thing,</hi> ys not enowgh, ſo much as to bring yt into the church, much les to cauſe yt <hi>to be ſo oft repeated:</hi> vnles alſo yt be ſo good, that nothing can be, for the tyme and place, better. Hether belongeth, that of <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 6. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>vayn repetitions,</hi> in the <note n="b" place="margin">pag. 804.</note> end of the book. where firſt with what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce he denieth, that he vnderſtood his wordes, <hi>wickedly wreſted</hi> of the Geneua translation cyted by the admonition, let the reader iudg of his wordes: wherein, rendring the reaſon of this charge, he ſaith, <hi>for the wordes of Christ, be not as they translate them, but &amp;c.</hi> Then let hym obſerue, that of diuers reaſons v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by me, to eſtablish that translation: he anſwereth not ſo much as one. To proue, <hi>that long prayers are not forbidden,</hi> which none denieth, alſo that the <hi>true translation is,</hi> that <hi>we should not bable much,</hi> which ys in effect the ſame with that of Geneua, he bringeth diuers autorityes: but, to proue, that our Sau. Chriſt meant to condemn, <hi>onely repetitions withowt faith,</hi> or that he condemned not, when one thing is ordinarily oft repeated in a ſmal tyme, which be the pointes in queſtion, nether the 4 firſt teſtimonies, nor the 2 ſection, haue one word of. As for that owt of M. <hi>Martyr,</hi> yt proueth that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of wordes withowt faith, is babling: but not, that th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at onely is babling, which (to put vs from this place of S. Mathew) owght to haue bene proued.</p>
                  <p>Nether doeth the example of our Sau. Chriſt, <hi>repeating the ſame wordes thriſe:</hi> help hym. For firſt yt appeareth not, in how short ſpace this was doen. Then, yt is vnmeet, of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry example of prayer made in ſome eſpecial eſtate, ether of exceding ioy, or of exceding affliction: to make a patern, for the ordinary prayers of the church. For when this repetition, is engendred of a zeal, which by this ioy, or affliction (as by more wood put vnder the furnais) is made whotter, then commonly yt vſeth to be, in the beſt of the children of god: yt is apparant, that where this ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nght of zeal is not, to ſend forth theſe repetitions, and with a ſtrong voice, to cauſe, as yt were, this Ecco: the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re (as hypokritical) they can not but diſpleaſe the lord. Therefore, the ordinary and vſual prayers of the church,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7987:110"/> owght to be ſo conceiued: as al the children of god, by that meaſure of zeal, which the lord commonly departeth vnto them, may be able to folow with affection. Yf ſome mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber can, by reaſon of ſuch particular ſcholing as is before ſpoken, ouershoot this commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mark: he hath his chamber at home alone, as our Sa. Chriſt had his garden here, where he may haue further ſcope. But, that the prayer of al the ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch, should be framed vnto hys eſtate: is no more conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, then, for that ſome one laboreth of the diſeas of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ut, al the whole church should haue an ordinary prayer, to be deliuered from that diſeas.</p>
                  <p>The ſame <note n="a" place="margin">Diui. 14. p. 497.</note> reaſon is, of the thankes giuing by <hi>magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, Benedictus, and nunc dimittis:</hi> which were made by oc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>caſion of certein particuler benefites, <hi>no more to be vſed for ordinary prayers, then the Aue Maria.</hi> whereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to he anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wereth, <hi>that that pertayneth to the virgin onely:</hi> euen ſo doe certein thinges conteyned in theſe pſalmes, ether agree to certein particular perſons onely, or els are ſuch as can not agree to vs. As to haue ſeen our Sa. Chriſt with <hi>bodily eyes,</hi> to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>bleſſed of al generations,</hi> to haue a ſon which should <hi>prepare the vuay to the ſon of god.</hi> And therefore, by his own anſwer, theſe verſes, at the leaſt, are no more to be day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid of vs, then the ſalutation of the virgin Mary. So that boeth for this cauſe, and the other before alledged of the pſalmes: yt is not conuenient, to make ordinary prayers of them. Nether doeth the reſpect, that they <hi>contein the miſtery of our redemption,</hi> ſerue to make them ordinary prayers: no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, then infinite other places of the ſcripture: yt proueth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they should be the ordinary textes, to preach on. The two next be <note n="b" place="margin">diui. 9 &amp; 11. Diuiſ. 17. p. 498.</note> anſwered.</p>
                  <p>To the defaut of the book aſsigned, <hi>for that there are no formes of thankes giuing, for the releas from thoſe common calamityes, from vuhich vue haue petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to be deliuered:</hi> althowgh he can here anſwer nothing, yet, as his maner ys,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7987:110"/> he blotteth paper. Howbeit, page 536 he goeth abowt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn this vpon my head, becauſe <hi>taxing the want of thanckes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing here, doe there finde faut, with the ſolemn thanckes giuing at weme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ns churching.</hi> whereunto I anſwer, that I doe not ſimply requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, a ſolemn and expres thancksgiuing for ſuch benefites, but onely vpon a ſuppoſition, which is, that yf yt be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that there should be expres prayers, againſt ſo many of theſe earthly miſeries: that then alſo, yt is meet, that, vpon the deliuerance, there should be an expres tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ckesgiuing. But whereas he ſaith, <hi>that thanckes are then giuen, for encreas of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des people, and deliuerance from ſyn:</hi> the firſt, ys here owt of tyme, as that which belongeth to baptim, and not to churching: nether is there any ſuch thing conteyned in the book. The other, is ſpoken firſt dangerously to the ſimple reader, as that which, hauing no good ſens, giueth alſo manifeſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ether the company in mariage, or the bringing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th of children (boeth which are commendable) is ſyn. Then yt is ſpoken slaunderously, in reſpect of the book: which, hauing no ſuch thing, is browght into ſuſpition of yt. Here alſo, yow should haue learned to mend your ſpeach, of <hi>our ſubiection vnto ſyn.</hi> For, althowgh the daungerous trauail of w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emen with childe, be a teſtimony of ſyn, which we commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: yet it is not a <hi>teſtimony of ſubiection vnto ſyn,</hi> in vs which are ſanctified: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering, that althowgh, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> ſyn <hi>dvuel in our mortal bodyes, yet it reigneth not ouer vs,</hi> nether are we ſubiectes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to yt.</p>

That owt of <hi>Zuinglius that yt is not neceſſary to baptiz in the church,</hi> I graunt: for the caſe may be ſuch, that yt may be baptized in the fieldes, but in a priuate hows, in this caſe of ſiknes, where there be ſet and ordinary meetinges in the church, I deny yt conuenient. Yf he mean by <hi>not neceſſary,</hi> that it is baptim, althowgh yt be not miniſtred in the ordinary aſſembly, I graunt: yf he mean, th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at yt ys not neceſſary to decency and good order: his own wordes, giue me anſwer enowgh. For as the tyme maketh conuenience, when yt is miniſtred ſo ſone as yt may be com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modiously, or inconuenience when yt is differred longer: ſo doeth the place.</p>
               <p>Albeit, S. <hi>Paul was a priſoner,</hi> yet the Iaylor being conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">Diuiſ. 3. p. 513.</note> would haue accorded hym, what <hi>place he had iudged meeteſt</hi> for baptim: therefore that example, had bene more apt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other <hi>of Peter,</hi> althowgh nether of them, make any thing for yow. As for that owt <hi>of Mathew 18, where two or three &amp;c,</hi> to proue that <hi>two be enow to make a congregation, wherein baptim may be ministred:</hi> firſt, yf it could come to pas, that there were but two perſons in the whole church, one to baptiz, the other to be baptized: I dowt, whether yt were meet to ſtay the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptim, vntil we ſaw whether the lord would giue further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas. But, that yt is conuenient, that in our church, yt sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld be miniſtred in the preſens of two or three onely: is a thing moſt vnworthy, of the dignity of the holy Sacrament: when as, yf the ciuil adminiſtration of iudgment should be handled ſo cornerlike, yt should worthely, be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>But what shal then be anſwered, to the place <hi>of S. Mathew?</hi> euen this, that our Sau. Chriſt ſpeaketh not there of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blik adminiſtring of the word and Sacramentes, but of the proceeding in the church diſcipline againſt offences, and of that part, which was doen priuately. For after he had taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7987:115"/> how from the admonition by one, we owght to proceed vnto that which is made by two or three, and ſo to the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis: hauing before ratified the proceeding of the church, he autoriſeth alſo by thys word, the admonition which, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th inuocation of his name, was giuen by thoſe two or three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> promiſing that yt shal not be in vayn, but haue effect that way, which god hath diſpoſed of, whether yt be to conuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the party, or to further making hym inexcuſable. Yf it be asked, why then our ſauiour Chriſt did not alſo ſpeak, of the ratifying of the firſt admonition by one: I anſwer, that he ſpake of the effect of theſe two later admonitions, not that the other should he withowt fruit, but for the excellency of the effect of theſe, before that. Vuhich was alſo therfore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edful, to be made mention of, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt: for ſo much as otherwiſe, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> experience of the ſynners hardnes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rt, in reiection of the firſt admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he which gaue yt, with the other one or two appointed for that matter, throwgh diſpair of his amendement, might be beaten bak, from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding any further with hym.</p>
               <p>To me acknowledging, <hi>that in the tyme of perſecution, yt may be in a priuate hous, as may alſo the publik preaching:</hi> he anſwereth, that the ſame <hi>may be doen in this neceſsity,</hi> which he repeateth in his 6 diuiſion, where ſtil he demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth that in queſtion. For yt is in queſtion, whether there is any ſuch neceſsity of baptim, as for the miniſtring thereof, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon decent order should be broken. And verely, by theſe kinde of ſpeaches, he playnly condemneth thoſe churches ether of neglect, or contempt of the holy ſacramentes: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch ſuffer none to be adminiſtred, but in the ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. Here, I leau to the readers iudgment, whether by this extraordinary adminiſtration, there be more dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of confirming this error, <hi>that children can not be ſaued, yf they dy before they haue receiued baptim:</hi> then the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring yt onely when the infantes may be conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly browght to the church, <hi>doeth confirm the error of the Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, which ſay that children may not be baptized, vntil they come to age:</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:7987:115"/> ſeing that, by the dayly practis of the church, in baptizing them, there can not riſe, the leaſt ſuſpition of this later er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
               <p>In ſaying, that I <hi>haue nether ſcripture, reaſon, nor Doctor:</hi> he kepeth but his wont. For <hi>ſcripture, and reaſon,</hi> let the reader iudg: for <hi>Doctor,</hi> I marueil what playner teſtimony can be, then that I alledged owt of Auguſtine, which noteth the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<note place="margin">contra Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               <p>In the next diuiſion, to diuers reaſons againſt this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony in Baptim, boeth ſimply, and in reſpect of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tyme, he anſwereth not a word: onely, he paſſeth the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, in shewing how <hi>the papistes vſed yt otherwiſe, then we doe,</hi> w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich is not in queſtion. In the next, to that alledged of <hi>the ſignification, making yt more popish:</hi> he anſwereth, that the papiſtes <hi>did not declare the ſignification, and that they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dumb with them:</hi> as thowgh their pulpites rung not often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes, of ſuch vnſauory voices, or that a number of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler papiſtes, knw not this popish deuinity. To that, <hi>that yt bringeth in a nue vuord into the church:</hi> he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>that there is nothing against yt in the word,</hi> which is vntrue. For, althowgh the ceremony of croſsing, were conuenient, yet to rayſe a doctrine of yt, is vnlawful: for aſmuch, as yt is not enowgh to teach the truth, vnles yt be truly tawght, and that is, onely owt of the word of god. Now, let hym shew a word of god, that two lynes laid croſwiſe: ſignifieth, that we should not be ashamed, of the paſsion or cros of Ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt.</p>
               <p>Hetherto belongeth, that which he hath 291, towching the ſurplice: where yt appeareth, that his defence in this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, is ſpekled and of diuers colours. For there, in the firſt ſection, he giueth playnly to vnderſtand, that he aloweth not, that a man <hi>should draw any ſuch ſignification from the apparel, as the admonition doeth, from ſitting at the lords ſupper.</hi> Now, the ſignification yt bringeth, <hi>of rest, and of a ful finishing, thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vugh Christ, of al the ceremonial lavu, and of a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption vurovught, that giueth reſt for euer:</hi> ys a holy doctrine, therefore yt foloweth, that he wil not haue, ſo mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch as an holy and an agreable doctrine, vnto the reſt of the ſcriptures, fetched owt of the wearing of the apparel: which is the ſame thing, which I affirm: namely, that yt is not eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wgh, that the thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſignified, be accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the ſcripture, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yt ſelf, be raiſed and grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:7987:120"/> So that hereby, he hath vtterly ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym ſelf: not onely, in the ſignification of the apparel, but alſo in this of the cros, and that after, of the ring. For, by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he misliketh <hi>al ſuch ſignification,</hi> in the one: he muſt needes mislike yt, in the other.</p>
               <p>I anſwer the ſuppoſed <hi>reaſon of M. Martyr,</hi> directly. For, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yt buildeth the wearing of a white ſurplice, vpon <hi>that the Miniſters are called angels:</hi> yt muſt folow, that the ſame cauſe th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at moueth the ſcripture, to bring in the Angels clad in w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hite, muſt be the leſſon, that the Miniſters haue to learn of their white apparel: which, whether yt be purenes, or glory, or boeth, yt being a true repreſentation in them, is (as I ſaid) a lying ſign in the Miniſters, which are miſerable and ſinful men. Herein alſo, to that which I obiected, <hi>that by the ſame reaſon the Ministers should vuear vuinges, becauſe the Angels are ſo deſcribed,</hi> he can anſwer nothing: whereunto ad, that hereof there is yet more cauſe. For the white appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, which the Angels wore, was no ſignification of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but of their pure and glorious nature, wherein they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re created, and wherein they ſtil remain: whereas, the wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, shadow forth their office, which is, that they are ſwift meſſengers of god, in al thinges whereunto they are ſent. Therefore, ſeing this reaſon wil haue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity betwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ſpirites, and Miniſters of the goſpel, to ſtand in reſpect of their office: their winges, being a picture of th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eir office, and not the whitenes of apparel: yt foloweth, th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the conformity should be rather in the winges, then in the whitenes of apparel.</p>
               <p>To that which I alledged, againſt them which make yt a ciuil matter, <hi>that by this ſignification yt is made eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical:</hi> he oppoſeth, that <hi>a graue apparel, putteth vs in minde of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity.</hi> Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And, yf he could proue, that the ſurplice were a fit garment for a Miniſter: I would not deny, but that he owght generally, be therby put in minde of his duty in that behalf. But, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should run owt into idle ſpeculations, of the colour, or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rm: I can not agree. For, no more then yt is meet, that vpon the eating of milk, ſyncerity and ſimplicity should be enio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yned: no more owght there vpon the white colour of the ſurplice, be raiſed any ſuch ſignification of glory and pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. In ciuil reſpect, and where the commodity of this life is onely regarded, the vſe of ſignifications is freer: as in Liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Seazon of a hows, by the ring, and of land by a clot or turft: but, where men are called to godlines of lyfe by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifications, there they nether owght to be withowt warra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nt of the word of god, nor yet can be ciuil. For a ciuil cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, doeth binde vs no further, then to the owtward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that, whereunto the ceremony is vſed: which yf we doe, althowgh it be with an euil minde, yet we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilly be charged.</p>
               <p>So long as the ſignification of the white in the ſurplice, is (as he ſuppoſeth) and ayd to godlines, ſo long <hi>yt is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and not indifferent:</hi> which is that which I ſaid, and which he confuteth not. Likewiſe in ſaying, that they are <hi>ſuppoſed strong to vuork godlines,</hi> I meant not, that the <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is in the garment,</hi> as yf yt could cauſe men to be godly: but I meant to aſcribe vnto yow, that in ſo ſpeaking of yt, yow match yt with the word of god. For the word of god yt ſelf, throwgh the peruerſnes of our nature: is not, withowt the working of gods holy ſpirit, ſtrong enowgh, to work godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in vs. And ſo my argument, <hi>yf vuhite haue strenght to
<pb facs="tcp:7987:121"/> moue to godlines, then that vuhich is vuhiter hath more:</hi> is good. For, nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g hath power to moue vnto godlines, but that which god hath ordeined for that purpoſe: and that w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich he hath ordeyned, hath of yt ſelf power to work that, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to he hath ordeined yt, if it light of a fit obiect, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to work vpon. In what ſens, I cal them <hi>Sacramente,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch are inſtituted with ſuch ſignifications: I haue before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>That which I ad there of our ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>vuhileſt vue vuil haue no painted, nor grauen, but vuouen images,</hi> agreeth alſo wel, vnto this matter of the cros. For, yf to ſet vp a wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cros in the church, with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement that in looking vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yt, we should reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber not to be ashamed of the cros of Chriſt, be a faut againſt the firſt table: the ſame reaſon is, of this cros of flesh: whereunto his anſwer, that thoſe <hi>are against the expres commandement of god,</hi> is <note n="a" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part and first Tract.</note> before confuted, where is sh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, <hi>that they are as vnlavuful, vuhich may be gathered or concluded to be forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the thinges, which are expresly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> And, here yt hath bene proued, that theſe ſignifications vpon ſuch groundes, are not according to the word of god. Beſide that, yt may peraduenture abuſe hym, that he taketh the word <hi>image,</hi> to reach no further then vnto the portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a man, or of ſome other liuing thing? whereas yt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>That there were no ſuch prayers in the Apoſtles ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, is shewed by a manifeſt reaſon of the ſcripture: which <hi>ſetting forth the ſmaleſt matters in Burial, vuould not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue</hi>

               <p>To that, that <hi>the Minister hauing othervuiſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary dutyes, as many as he can turn hym to, hath notvuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hſtanding by this meanes, anue charge laid vpon hym:</hi>

               <p>The firſt argument, againſt the inconuenience of funeral<note place="margin">Diuiſ. 5. p. 733.</note> ſermons: hath the ſame mayntenance, with the firſt of the third diuiſion. To the next reaſon <hi>of the ſodein, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (for the moſt part) negligent preaching:</hi> he oppoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th as a <hi>contrariety with my ſelf, that I preferred a ſimple ſermon made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day, to that which is made onely once in a moneth,</hi> which is onely to miſpend the tyme. For, althowgh I preferred yt, to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yet I approued not, that one onely Miniſter (except he haue rare giftes) should preach euery day. <hi>why he can not haue ſufficient warning, is manifeſt:</hi> yf he <hi>refuſe,</hi> he is thereby loden with diſpleaſure of his parishoners, in that he doeth not, as oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is hurtful to his ordinary miniſtery.</p>
               <p>To the reaſon <hi>of acceptation of perſons, in that ſermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ns at the burial of the rich, nether be, nor are able to be made, at the burial of the poor:</hi> he anſwereth, that <hi>yt is alone, as if the Minister not able to preach euery day, should not the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore preach once a weke.</hi> Vuhich is vntrue, conſidering th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at his ordinary miniſtery, is commanded of god, where th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is is but a deuiſe of men, and conſidering that in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary preaching, there is no acceptation of perſons, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hether yt be doen once, or often in a week: ſo that, alth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owgh preaching, muſt be neceſſarily had, yet preachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng at burials, is not meet, vnles withal yt be doen wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thowt
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7987:126"/> inconueniences. He denieth yt alſo, to be acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of perſons, houlding forth the obiection which I gaue hym: but the anſwer vnto yt, he towcheth not. Likewiſe, he ſaith, that there <hi>is ſometymes more occaſion to preach at the rich mans burial, then at the poors:</hi> but he ſaith yt onely, for proof he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth none.</p>
               <p>My argument, he anſwereth not, which is, that <hi>the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe</hi>

                  <hi>vuhy burial ſermons vuere brovught in, of giuing of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous men their commendation, vuas inſufficient: conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that the ſame vuas doen, by the holy Prophetes, moſte able and vuilling to doe yt by ſermon, yf yt had bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.</hi> Likewiſe, <hi>to the infamous beginninges of theſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſermons, from infidels,</hi> he ſaith nothing: onely he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeth the tyme, in oppoſing the autority, which I confeſſed. by which kinde of reaſoning, he may alſo bring in, <note n="a" place="margin">Ierom. ad Euſtochium de mort Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ulae.</note> torches at noon dayes, <note n="b" place="margin">Ambro. de obitu.

               <p>The firſt ſect. is anſwered, in the 3 diuiſion.

The <hi>general ſorow</hi> of the church, in the death of a member, may be eaſely ſuſteyned, by the ordinary teachinges: but, they that be ſpecially wounded, owght to haue a ſpecial plaſter. wherein, that which he affirmeth of the <hi>exhortation giuen gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, to be as apt to comfort as when yt is particularly applied:</hi> is boeth a manifeſt vntruth, and directly contrary to hym ſelf: which<note place="margin">pag. 601.</note> ſaith, <hi>None douteth, but that a man is more moued, by that which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to hym particularly, then he is, with that ſpoken generally, aſwel to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7987:126"/> as to hym ſelf.</hi> And hereby, yt may appear, how inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent yt is: to clog the miniſter with this voluntary charge of preaching at burials, which, beſide his ordinary miniſtery, hath ſo neceſſary a duty caſt vpon hym, in the death of his parishoners: whereunto, ad alſo, the travail and care, toward the deceaſed, during his ſiknes.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſection is anſwered, in diui. 3. To that, of <hi>tying</hi>

               <head>THE EIGHT CHAPTER, OF the ſecond part of this Treatiſe: of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, and other apparel, taken from popery.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Gainſt their importunacy which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture ſay, that I leaped the matter of apparel, throwgh conſcience of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our cauſe: yt shal not be much owt of the way, to run yt ouer, that yt may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, boeth how little there is which hath not bene anſwered, and how little weight yt hath, which remayneth to be anſwered. The firſt diuiſ. is <note n="a" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part.</note> anſwered, ſo is the ſecond: for further anſwer whereunto, I refer the reader to the <note n="b" place="margin">In the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Apolo. 5. ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt. 1. diui. p. 385. ſect. 3</note> Bishop of Salisburys book, where he shal perceiue, how directly the D. is contrary vnto hym, in that point. As for the laſt ſection, yt is anſwered in the firſt part of this tractate: ſauing, that he miſconſtrueth my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, in affirming me to ſay, that <hi>monumentes of Idolatry may be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the church, yf ſome manifeſt profit doe appear.</hi> Vuhere as, my meaning is playn, that they owght to haue no entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the church: not onely, for that they are monumentes of Idolatry, but becauſe there appeareth, no manifeſt profit of them. For, althowgh I wil not enter, into that queſtion: yet I can not ſee, how that which is properly a monument of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, can haue any good vſe in the church. That, thinges ordeyned to good vſes, and after co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted to Idolatry, may be profitable, I graunt: but, that a thing shal be profitable, in the church eſpecially, whoſe natiuity and firſt birth, was conſecrated to an Idol, and which the firſt day yt was inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was applied vnto Idolatry, I think, the Anſw. is not <hi>able</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diuiſ. 3. pa. 257.</note> 
                  <hi>to shew.</hi> In the next, the firſt part of the firſt ſection, the reader hath to iudg of: vpon the reaſons alledged, and vpon the common experience. His queſtion, is onely to blot paper: being afterward preciſely boeth moued, and <note n="c" place="margin">diuiſ. 6. p. 278.</note> anſwered by me.</p>
               <p>For proof, that ſome think the ſacrament better admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:7987:127"/> with, then withowt a ſurplice: I alledged, as witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, them <hi>vuhich ſay, I vuil not communicate, vnles he vue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar a ſurplice.</hi> whereunto he anſwereth, that <hi>yt may come of iust cauſe: when the Minister, by not wearing, sheweth an example of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> Vuhereby, he firſt aloweth that men should abſteyn from the Communion, for want of a ſurplice: then, in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rt he giueth the execution of the lawes, to priuate men, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ntrary to the law of god, and of the realm. Vuhereas, yf the Miniſter did euil, in not taking a ſurplice, and would not giue place to their admonition: yt behoued them, to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the ſacramentes, and hear the word at his hand, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to complain of the diſorder, to thoſe to whome the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection belongeth.</p>
               <p>His reaſon, that <hi>none which are perſwaded to communicate wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th vs, think the ſacrament better or wors for a ſurplice, for that they are diſſwaded from greater thinges:</hi> is inſufficient. For, there were I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,<note place="margin">a 1. Cor. 8. Rom. 14.</note> which were browght from confidence in them ſelues, and in their own workes, to ſeek for their ſaluation in Chr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt: which in a peece of a holy day, or a bit of flesh, which is far les, put great religion. Vuhere the lord taketh a man by the hand, there he may leap ouer a wal: but where, to let vs haue experience of our own weaknes, he reacheth not his hand: there, a little ſtone in the way is not withowt danger.</p>
               <p>But <hi>admit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they haue a religion:</hi> yet <hi>becauſe their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is as great, which think the ſacramentes polluted by this apparel, yt is conuenient, yt should be vſed, and their errors confuted.</hi> This <hi>conuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi> did S. Paul neuer know: yf he had, he would vndowtedly haue tawght yt, when the like queſtion in meates, as this is in apparel, was moued in the church. For ſo, he had had an eaſy way, to haue compounded betwene the Iues and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, yf he could haue tawght the Corinthes, which were ſo loth to be abbridged of their liberty, that they might vſe yt before the weak brother, ſo that thei gaue hym inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of yt: whereas, the Apoſtle plainly forbidde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th to eat before him, as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as he remaineth in that weaknes
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7987:128"/> what other thing, is this therefore: then to ſet, the Apoſtle to ſchole? The 2 ſection of the next diuiſion, is <note n="a" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part Tract. the firſt.</note> anſwered: ſo are the <note n="b" place="margin">Ib. p. 403.</note> two other: likewiſe the <note n="c" place="margin">In the firſt part of this Tract. Diuiſ. 1 pa. 262.</note> three next: the next vnto them belongeth onely, vnto the readers iudgment.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſection, hath nothing but wordes. His ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that <hi>Saul knew not Samuel to be a Prophet, for want of a mark in his apparel, but forſomuche as he was a rudesby in the common we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alth, as Master Martyr ſaith:</hi> is to very little or no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>For he ſaith not, that Saul knw not, what maner of apparel the Prophetes wore: but onely, that he knw not Samuels pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rticular perſon. Now, they may wel ſtand boeth togither, th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at Saul knw the Seers particular apparel, if any were: and yet not know Samuels own perſon. where, he would get this owt, of the which is deſcription of Samuel, <hi>by a mantel:</hi> he may as wel ſay, that yt was a proper mark to the Miniſters of the word, <hi>to be ould:</hi> ſeing the one as wel as the other, is giuen as a mark, to ſet forth Samuel by: howſoeuer he, boeth abſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rdly, and withowt any aſsiſtance of reaſon, doeth deny this. For, I would know of hym, why she nameth hym an ould man, yf yt were not for this cauſe, that he might the eaſelier acknowledg hym for Samuel: and, how could a mantel be a ſufficient note of diſcretion of Samuel, from other Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, which were dead, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as hym ſelf ſaith, that <hi>al the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes wore the ſame kinde of weed.</hi> Laſt of al, ſeing Samuel was, as he <note n="d" place="margin">pag. 262.</note> alledgeth, a <hi>Prophet, a Magiſtrate, and a Captayn of the host:</hi> yf he had had a peculier kinde of garment, why might yt not as wel be, the proper garment of the Prince, or Captayn, as of the Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Towching the <hi>proper apparel of thoſe Prophetes,</hi> which were extraordinarily rayſed vp, whereof he maketh ſuch large diſcours: it was confeſſed, and the reaſon beaten vpon his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wn head, where yt cleaueth ſtil. For, yt was alledged, that <hi>they vuere notes of their extraordinary calling, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore vnmeet for vs, vuhoſe calling ovught to be ordinary:</hi> whereunto he anſwereth not. And, if he wil haue the Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ps now, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formed vnto the prophetes in their apparel: they
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7987:128"/> muſt were commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, cours, homely, and vile cloth. For, ſo M. <hi>Caluin,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whome he prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth his help, deſcribeth yt. But,<note place="margin">vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Zacha. 13.</note> where is Luther now become, which ſaith, that the <hi>dſtiincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the apparel, amongest the Ministers vnder the gosp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, is not conuenient.</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">pag. 150.</note> before, he could take Luther, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>au M. Caluin: here, in the ſame Prophet, the ſame chapter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd almoſte the ſame vers, he hath caſt of Luther, and layd hould of M. Caluin: which notwithſtanding maketh nothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng for hym. For, the doctrine which he gathereth, that the <hi>Ministers apparel, should be graue and ſparing,</hi> withowt rufling in their ſilkes, and veluetes: is that which we deſire, and hym ſelf, with others whome he defendeth, faut in. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is his other place, owt of M. <hi>Caluin,</hi> any thing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for the Anabaptiſtes, condemn the vſe of armour, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch is not onely not forbidden, but alſo, in ſome caſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of god. Nether doe we diſalow, any of this apparel ſimply, as vnlawful: but as inconuenient, and that not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, but to that vſe, whereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to yt is (eſpecially in theſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and with theſe circumſtances) applied.</p>
               <p>His plaſter for al ſores, of a <hi>negatiue argument,</hi> vnto our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that <hi>the ſcripture maketh no mention, of any diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of apparel, for the Minister of the goſpel:</hi> as in other pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, ſo here eſpecially, yt healeth not. For, there is not the leaſt thing, incident vnto a Miniſter, as he is a Miniſter: but yt is comprehended, in the word of god, els, let hym giue an inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or one onely exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple: whereof, alſo this may be a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od witnes, that S. Iohns apparel, which was ſeueral, is ſet fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rth ſo diligently, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the very girdle. And, ſeing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle entred, into me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of the Miniſters apparel, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he <note n="b" place="margin">1. Tim. chap. 3.</note> willeth yt <hi>should be honest:</hi> yf he had thowght yt needful, that he should haue had a mark in yt, to be knowen by, how eaſely could he haue noted yt: which was inſtructed by the holy goſt, of al thinges profitable, to aduance the miniſtery of the goſpel, How vain a thing then ys yt, that the D. would bear vs in hand: that yt is ſo <hi>profitable and ſo conuenient, for their
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:7987:129"/> ministery.</hi> Vuhat alſo, that the Apoſtle, where need is, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melynes doeth require: contenteth not hym ſelf, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in general that the apparel should be honeſt, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth alſo to the very form of the apparel: as, when he commandeth, that <hi>vuemen should haue a long garment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>1. Tim.</hi> 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>comming dovun to their foot.</hi> Vuhen therefore, the Apoſtle appointing this long garment for wemen, did leau yt free vnto Miniſters, which fashion of long garment, of al other, ſeemeth to be moſte fitteſt for a Miniſter, and ſeemlieſt in al places: what can we think, but that he would haue the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter free, in this behalf.</p>
               <p>Vuhere he taketh for <hi>graunted by me, that ſome of the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les vſed a ſeueral apparel:</hi> he is to light handed, in taking that, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich I neuer gaue. For, when as in ſpeaking of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, Apoſtles, and our Sauiour Chriſt, I confes that <hi>ſome of them had a peculiar garment:</hi> yt is manifeſt, vpon my diſcours, that I meant the Prophetes onely, which were extraordinarily rayſed. And ſo far I wil graunt, his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: otherwiſe, yf ſome onely of the Apoſtles had a ſpecial garment, how could that be a mark of his miniſtery, when the reſt of the Apoſtles, which were fellowes in the ſame mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, had not? And therefore, I meruail, how yow dare pr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es S. <hi>Iohns thin plate</hi> vpon his head: ſeing that Euſebius, note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th that of hym as a ſinguler attire, from other the Apoſtles: whereas, if yt had bene a mark, of the miniſtery of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleship, other Apoſtles, should haue had the like. Yf yt had bene a mark of his <hi>Archbishoprik</hi> (whereunto, from the hal to the kytchin, yow vſe ſometyme to promote hym) th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en al the other ſuppoſed Archbishopes, did wear the ſame: which is, as far from Euſebius minde, as the other. So, yo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ur concluſion, that <hi>if ſome of the Apostles had a ſeueral apparel, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore al the ministers may haue ſuch a note of their miniſtery,</hi> is to bad: yt rather argueth, the clean contrary: that, for ſo much as the Apoſtles leauing nothing vndoen, which might make for the furtherance of their miniſtery, differed amongeſt them ſelues in the form of apparel, one wearing <hi>a leaf of his head,</hi> the reſt wearing no ſuch thing: that therefore, yt pertayneth not
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:7987:129"/> to the furtherance of the miniſtery, that al should be enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to wear one form of apparel.</p>
               <p>The reaſon, which I browght to proue, that Peter had no ſpecial apparel, whereby he could be diſcerned, to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of the twelue: he vtterly diſſembleth. His two laſt shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes againſt yt, are fond eſcapes. For the perſecuting Iues, would nether haue ſpared candle, for remedy <hi>of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the night:</hi> nor haue ſtood geſsing, and ſuſpecting, when as they might haue had, a ſufficient and a certein mark in his apparel, to know hym by. In his firſt exception, <hi>that it may be, that he put of his vppermoſt garment:</hi> he bewrayeth his to great bouldnes, by running in the maz of his own head, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thowt any thred of the word of god, to bring hym owt. For, when the Euangeliſt <note n="a" place="margin">MarK. 14. 52.</note> maketh expres mention, of one of their infirmities, that to ſaue hym ſelf, caſt away his vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per garment: he would, if there had bene any ſuch thing, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue doen the ſame of Peter.</p>
               <p>In his anſwer, of our Sau. Chriſts garment: for one faut, he maketh two. For, he ſaith, that <hi>S. Iohn would not haue made mention of yt, vnles yt had bene a ſeueral apparel:</hi> which is a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſaying, conſidering that yt is manifeſt, that he noteth yt to haue had no ſeam, to shew the occaſion that the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diars toke, of caſting lottes for yt. Vuhereby, boeth Daui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ds<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 29. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> propheſy of hym, was fulfilled: and he the better kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, to be the ſame, of whome the Prophet ſpake. Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, this garment wherein the Anſw. wil haue, the mark of our Sauiour Chriſts miniſtery, was his coat and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garment: and therefore, not ſo fit to shew forth his miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as he paſſed by the ſtreates, conſidering that yt was hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by his cloke, or mantel, which he wore vpon yt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd, if our Sauiour Chriſt, had the note of his miniſtery in his coat, then, althowgh S. Peter (as he deuineth) had put of his vpper: yet, they might haue knowen hym, by his vnder garment, which was alſo a proper note of his miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Vnles, he wil peraduenture ſay, that our Sauiour Chriſt, wear the mark of his miniſtery vpon his coat, and S. Peter his, vpon his cloke: which in this bouldnes he is entred into
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7987:130"/> peraduenture he wil not ſtik to doe. Laſt of al, this iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our <hi>Sau. Christs ſeueral apparel, like vnto Iohn Baptiſts:</hi> is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to the <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 11. 16. LuK. 7. 31.</note> Euangeliſtes. which shew, that he in his owtward faſchion of lyfe, toke another way then S. Iohn Baptiſt: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely, for that where S. Iohn choſe a path, throwgh which he ſeparated hym ſelf, from the ordinary and accuſtomable trade of other men, our Sau. Chriſt folowed the common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd high way, that other went. which, being expresly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned of his diet, muſt by the ſame reaſon be vnderſtood of his apparel: conſidering that that was one of the two poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, wherein S. Iohn ſowght a ſingularity. The <hi>contrariety with my ſelf,</hi> is before <note n="b" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer part Tract. 1. Diuiſ. 1. pa. 265.</note> anſwered: the next diuiſion, I pas by.</p>
               <p>Vuhether the Magiſtrate <hi>may comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a ſeueral apparel,</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, <hi>vuhether he may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand the popish:</hi> conſidering, that he that getteth the firſt, hath not therefore won the ſecond: whereunto, the D. beſide wordes partly id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, <hi>of genus taken vniuerſaliter,</hi> partly boeth idle and fond, <hi>of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum in modo</hi> &amp;c, anſwereth not. But now, in ſted of his former affirmation which was, that the <hi>Magiſtrate may appoint a ſeueral apparel:</hi> he hath ſet down <hi>that he may appoint any kinde of apparel:</hi> As yf theſe two, to <hi>appoint an apparel, and to appoint any apparel,</hi> were al one. In which dealing, let yt be obſerued, that where in his firſt affirmation, he would haue fayn changed his queſtion, of the popish apparel, for a better: now, to defend his wandring, he hath, for a cauſe which was not good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, gotten one which is a great deal wors: the norishing whereof, wil ſtand hym in more, then did the other. So that, in ſted of ſetting on a peece: he hath here made the rent, a great deal bigger. For, if the Magiſtrate may lawfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Miniſters, any kinde of apparel: he may comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them to wear purple colored garmentes, which being <hi>comely for <hi rend="sup">c</hi> youth,</hi> should not be ſo for the Miniſter, that<note place="margin">1 Ariſt. Rhe. 2. ad Theo.</note> beareth the perſon of an ancyent. Likewiſe, he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to wear (as <note n="d" place="margin">Ariſt. po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit. 2.</note> Hippodamas did) <hi>furred clothes boeth vuinter, and ſommer:</hi> alſo a Souldiars weed, which M. Caluin (of whom he ſeeketh fauor in this cauſe) <hi rend="sup">e</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7987:130"/> 
                  <hi>to be against common ſens:</hi> how much more, yf he should command them, to wear a womans habite. Yf yow except, that theſe thinges be not <hi>comely:</hi> nether is that required (for any thing that I can ſee) by your defence but onely, that he propound yt, as a thing for <hi>comelynes and orders ſake,</hi> withowt any conſcience of religion. Althowgh, to anſwer, that theſe thinges are <hi>vncomely and vnorderly, and that the ſurplice and cope &amp;c are comely and orderly:</hi> is onely, a bare demaund of that in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: Beſide that, when any of theſe kindes of apparel sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld be eſtablished, by the ſuperior powers, as orderly and comely: yow teach vs, that yt belongeth not vnto vs, which <hi>are priuate, to iudg whether yt be otherwiſe, but to them alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that I ſaid, that in the <hi>appointing of any ſeueral ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel vnto the Ministers, there is ſome iniury doen to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> he maketh a noyſe, as yf <hi>Hannibal vuere at the city gates:</hi> but if the prouerb be true, that a <hi>deep vuater is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſtil,</hi> there is like to be no great deapth of reaſon or knowledg, to mayntein that with, which is born owt with ſuch owtcries. Vuhatſoeuer it be, let vs ſound yt. His firſt anſwer is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>choſen by the church, the Magiſtrate can not know, what kinde of minister euery parish hath:</hi> euen as wel, as when he is choſen by the Bishop: for, the Prince is agreed, to haue the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and allowance of the election by the church, aſwel as of his. Althowgh, this is no anſwer to my reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was, that <hi>the Magistrate may vuel alovu of hym, as for one vuhich knovueth vuhat apparel is meet for his eſtate, vuhom he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovueth, as an able man to gouern his people, betvuene god and them:</hi> ſo that my reaſon is, of his <hi>alovuance,</hi> and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nſwer is, of <hi>his knowledg.</hi> And, if withowt any particular know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledg of hym, he may alow of hym as of a fit Miniſter: he may withowt the ſame knowledg, alow of hym, as one which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to wear his own apparel.</p>
               <p>His ſecond reaſon is, that the <hi>Magistrate aloweth hym, with condition of being obedient:</hi> which is vtterly from the purpoſe.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7987:131"/> For, the queſtion is not here, what the Miniſter may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey, but what the Magiſtrate may lawfully command: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nd yt was ſet down, that the <hi>Miniſter, as alſo other ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes, might, in ſome caſe, vuith good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience obey that, vu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich the Magistrate can not vuith ſo good a conſcience co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi> His third reaſon is, that the <hi>Magiſtrate may be deceiued in hym:</hi> whereunto I anſwered, that he might then punish hym, according as the faut requireth, to the which he replieth not.

               <p>Howbeit, the Anſw. which in deliuering his reaſons by tale, oftentymes giueth but eleuen to the doſen: hath giuen vs here at vnwares, thirten. For as for his former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yf yt had not bene, in ſuch a slippery place of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto the Magiſtrate, with the contrary whereof, he ſo often and ſo vniuſtly chargeth vs: I would not haue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, vouchſafed to haue named them. His reaſon, that <hi>other wiſe men may alledg, that they nede not to be preſcribed in their apparel,</hi> which he counteth not: hath, of al other, the greateſt colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ur, and yet yt is anſwered before. For, althowgh there be, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich know how to wear their apparel, as wel as the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rs: yet <hi>by calling</hi> there is none, of whome yt owght to be ſo much preſumed, as of them: <hi>yt being,</hi> as yt was alledged, <hi>vuithin the</hi>

                  <hi>compas of their charge, to teach the people to vuear theirs:</hi> which charge of teaching the people, belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to no other eſtate. There being therefore, ſo good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the Miniſter should be left vnto his honeſt liberty, in this matter: yt muſt needes ſeem hard, that his eſtate, sh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ould herein be inferior almoſte, nay altogither to al the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and eſtates in the land. For, the <hi>Iudges, Sergeantes,</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermens</hi> ſeueral apparel, is not (for any thing I could euer le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arn) ſo enioyned them: but that they may ſome tymes, and that in publik places, vſe the apparel, which to them ſelues ſeemeth good. And, I would know of the Anſ. which maketh ſuch adoe abowt this ſaying: whether he thinketh, that yf t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7987:131"/> Magiſtrate should appoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Miniſter, a ſeueral and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript diet from al other men, he should not doe that, with ſome iniury vnto the miniſtery. And verely, the caſe is not vnlike: eſpecially, ſeing in S. Iohn Baptiſts miniſtery, which the lord would haue diſcerned, he would haue yt aſwel diſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned, by a ſpecial diet, as by a ſpecial apparel. At the leaſt, this is certayn, that if it be wel reaſoned of hym, that yt is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenient, to appoint the Miniſters of the goſpel a ſeueral ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, becauſe Iohn Baptiſt had ſo: yt is as good a reaſon, th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Miniſters, should haue a ſeueral diet appointed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe S.

Likewiſe, vnto my reply, that <hi>nether S.

By how much more, I mervaile at the D. inconſtancy: which page 275 citeth a ſentence, to proue that the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of the apparel in the myniſtery, as wel as in other eſtates, is not material. He alledged alſo one of theſe examples, to wit <hi>of Iuſtin wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Philoſophers apparel, after his receiuing to the miniſtery:</hi> which he would neuer haue doen, yf there had bene an vniform fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchion of apparel, appointed vnto the Miniſters.

               <p>Vnto the particular reaſons of <hi>Birrus,</hi> becauſe he could not anſwer: he hath feyned a nw ſignification of a <hi>thyn plate,</hi> contrary to the autority of the Calepine, that proueth yt to be a garment of cours and heary cloth, of no price.

Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, the word ſignifiyng <hi>Slauonish,</hi> declareth, that yt was not proper to any degree of men, but to the cuntrey, ether becauſe the cloth, or faſchion, came from thens. His reaſon, that they were <hi>particular kinde of uestimentes, becauſe the names be expreſſed:</hi> is to shameful, as yf there were no other cauſe, to name them: whereas, the naming of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, maketh to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinty of the ſtory. And further, in Cyprians garmentes, yt maketh to his commendation: which, in giuing his garme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ntes according to the quality of the perſons, vſed diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and declareth hym, to haue bene of a preſent minde, in the very point of death.

               <p>But yt shal appear, that this white garment, had the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me eſtimation in Ieroms tyme: and therefore alſo in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtoms.

But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaith, that the place which he cyteth owt of the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncel of Carthage, may be a ſufficient confutation of al, which is ſaid of Ieroms places:</hi> ſeing we haue no credit with hym, let hym he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Eraſmus, which affirmeth, that <hi>vuhite garmentes vuere</hi>

               <p>So is yt alſo apparant, that the place of the <hi>Carthage coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, towching the Deacons white apparel:</hi> ys nothing els, but that the Deacon did in the church onely, wear that apparel, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch the Bishops and Prieſtes (as thoſe which were more eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) did wear boeth within, an withowt the church.

And if there had bene, no ſuch particuler commandement: yet th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſe which should haue applied theſe abuſed thinges, to the
<pb facs="tcp:7987:134"/> vſe of the deuine ſeruice, had had better ground for them in the general commandement, then he can shew, to bring in the ſurplice and cope. For, the lord hauing once declared that he would be ſerued in his temple, by the ſpices and ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of theſe creatures of gould &amp;c: they might wel know, that he could not leſe his right, by any wrong that men cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ld doe. Therefore, he should haue compared our cope and ſurplice, with the Idolatrous cope: whereunto, the lues are bidden to ſay, <hi>get the hence.</hi> wherein, althowgh the Anſ. ſay,<note place="margin">Iſay. 30.</note> that <hi>our cope is nothing of that nature:</hi> yet, he can shew no reaſon why. And, as our cope and ſurplice, are wel matched with that Idolatrous cope: ſo are the ox, gould &amp;c, wel matched, not with the ſurplice and cope, as he matched them, but wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th water, bread, and wyne, which our Sau.

The ſum is, that vnles he shew as good ground for the ſurplice and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe &amp;c, as we can for this gould &amp;c: he leeſeth al his labour here, which was alſo alledged.

               <p>In the next diuiſion, he anſwereth nothing, for defence of his firſt propoſition. For, yt is manifeſt, that a <hi>lavuful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate may command an vnlavuful thing,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he proteſt, that <hi>yt is for orders ſake onely.</hi> For, as for that he addeth, <hi>withowt any ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> yf it be vnderſtood, that the Magiſtrate doeth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand yt ſuperſtitiously, t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat doeth not heal vp the matter, ſeing he may faut by other wayes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yf he vnderſtand, that the ſubiectes doe not abuſe yt to ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yt is that in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, he is falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> again fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelf. For <note n="b" place="margin">279.</note> before, he anſwereth as thowgh a church ceremony, might be comely, and not tend to edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: inaſmuch, as to me obiecting, <hi>that yt ovught to tend to edification,</hi> he anſwereth, <hi>that yt is ſufficient, yf yt pertayn to order and comelines.</hi> Here, preſuming comelines, he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thereof: that not onely yt tendeth to edification, but <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that yt edifieth.</hi> The reſt, is an open asking of that in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy: that onely excepted, which is before anſwered.</p>
               <p>Againſt his reaſon, that <hi>the ſurplice edifieth, becauſe thoſe which
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7987:136"/> wear yt, edify:</hi> I alledged <hi>the Midvuiues lye,</hi> whereunto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth nothing to the purpoſe: but that, which I gaue hym, which is not enowgh to mayntein hym, ſeing he propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded generally, that thoſe <hi>thinges edify, which are doen by them w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich edify.</hi> And, what auantageth yt hym, to proue that this apparel may be worn, that the <hi>lye profited:</hi> when yt owght not to haue bene doen, yf yt might haue ſaued al the world. The<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 8.</note> ſimilitude <hi>of stammering,</hi> is vnanſwered. For, ſeing he is browght to that pinch, that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here aſsign no other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, why they edify, then becauſe <hi>the Minister can not otherwiſe be admitted to preach:</hi> yf there should be a Magiſtrate, which, in contempt of the goſpel, should ordeyn that none should preach, but thoſe which ſtammer: he ſeeth, that the ſimilitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de houldeth. Yf this example, be not <hi>graue and ſad</hi> enowgh, to match with the cope, which hath bene alwayes eſtemed, ſo fit for a players garment: let hym take the example in oyl &amp;c, propounded vnder the ſame conditions. The reſt, is anſwered.</p>
               <p>In the next, to the reaſons againſt his aſſertion, that the <hi>wearing of the ſurplice, maketh the wearers to agree in other pointes of doctrine, and the not wearing to diſagree:</hi> he partly anſwereth not, and the anſwer which he maketh, hangeth altogither of bl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde experience. I cal yt blinde, becauſe he can giue no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of yt: and therefore, as that which hath no light to shew yt by, yt muſt needes be vnuiſible. As for his vntrue ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that <hi>we imagin a perfection, whereby we haue no need of lawes or Magiſtrate,</hi> they neuer fail hym: as if yt were not, emongeſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a ſinguler vſe and profite of the Magiſtrate: to procure by lawes and punishmentes, that thoſe meanes, which god hath ordeyned to mayntein godly vnity with, be ſtraytly obſerued, althowgh he deuiſe none of his own. The next di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, is <note n="a" place="margin">In the ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apter of the ceremonies of Baptim and in the former pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rt of this booK. p. 92.</note> anſwered.</p>
               <p>In the next, being not able to cary his reaſon, <hi>they are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of good thinges, therefore they are good,</hi> any further: he diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth yt vpon M. <hi>Bucer,</hi> which hath yt not: alſo vpon <hi>the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe of ſpeach,</hi> which he alſo slaundereth. For, we doe not <hi>cal yt a good ſign comonly:</hi> vnles that, as the thing is good, ſo the ſign
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7987:136"/> to mark yt owt with, be agreable. And, yf he preſume that he<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re in the ſurplice, he openly beggeth the queſtion: otherwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, what is he, that wil ſay, that a wolfs skyn is a good ſign of a lamb, becauſe the lamb which is good, is clothed in yt: alt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>howgh, his anſwer is nothing but a shift. For he conſidered not, what the thing <hi>is in common ſpeach:</hi> but what yt is in deed, and in reaſon. The example <hi>of the goulden calf,</hi> was wel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. For, yt was to the Iſraelites, a ſign of the true god, b<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ut a nawghty, and a wicked ſign: and ſo, yf none but Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rs of the goſpel, did wear the ſurplice: I would confes, that with vs yt were a ſign of a Miniſter of the goſpel, but yet an vncomely, and an inconuenient ſign. And to the intent the reader may know, how vnfaithfully the D. dealeth with him, in houlding owt M. Bucers autority for the ſurplice, and the reſt of this popish apparel: he may vnderſtand, that <note n="a" place="margin">Bucer in cenſur. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urg. Anglic.</note> he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth boeth for that it ſerueth to ſuperſtition in many, and for diuers other cauſes, require <hi>that they should be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vuay in our church.</hi> His firſt ſection, is to no purpoſe, of th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at which I towched hym for. In the next, his anſwer that <hi>the abuſe of the braſen ſerpent, could not be taken away, oneles the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion yt ſelf were:</hi> is withowt al proof, and may be as wel ſaid, of this apparel. For, althowgh no man <hi>worship the apparel,</hi> by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down before yt: yet he may haue a damnable opinion of yt, and as hard to be pulled owt, as the other. Beſide that, by how much the abuſe of the ſerpent, was greater, then of this apparel: by ſo much, was the profit of the braſen ſerpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nt, if yt had bene called to the right vſe, withowt compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon greater, then of theſe ceremonies. And althowgh the neceſſary and commanded vſe of the ſerpent, were <hi>but for the tyme, wherein yt was a mean to heal thoſe which were bitten:</hi> yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, yt had a notable vſe, of <hi>continuyng the remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of gods vuo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful benefite to vuards that people,</hi> whereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he anſwereth not: Els, I ask of hym, why it was continued in the church ſo many hundred yeares, vnder ſo many boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th good kinges, and godly Prieſtes.</p>
               <p>His anſwer, to that obiected <hi>of the loue feaſtes:</hi> I receiue,
<pb facs="tcp:7987:137"/> ſo far as concerneth the inconuenience of <hi>keping them in that place, wherein the lords ſupper was celebrated.</hi> Howbeit, to that, <hi>that the church hath, for the abuſe, vtterly taken thoſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes avuay, notvuithſtanding that they vuere likely meanes to norish loue vuith:</hi> he anſwereth not. That thoſe <hi>loue feaſtes were borowed of the Gentiles,</hi> is vnlike: conſidering that S. Peter giueth ſufficiently to vnderſtand, that they were vſed in the churches of the Iues, which abhorred from the ceremonies<note place="margin">2. Epiſt. ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ap. 2. 13.</note> of the Gentiles. For, writyng vnto the churches of the Iues, he alludeth plainly vnto that of S. Iude: where theſe feaſtes, are expresly named. Yt is much more probable, that they were taken from the imitation of the Iues vnder the law: w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ho<note place="margin">Deuter. 14. 23. 29.</note> are bidden to feaſt before the lord in Ieruſalem. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, are commended vnto them, as geſts and partakers of t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he ſame bleſsing of god with them, ſtraungers and wido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, with other nedy and deſtitute perſons: which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to haue bene, one of the endes of this loue feaſt. The two firſt ſections, are nothing but an asking of that in dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aund: eſpecially hauing regard to this point, whether this apparel be conuenient for the miniſtery or no, or whether, being inconuenient, yt owght ſo to be declared, in which pointes this queſtion lieth. As towching that point, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Miniſter should wear yt, althowgh yt be inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: the truth is, that I dare not be autor to any, to forſake his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral charge for the inconuenience thereof: conſidering t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat this charge being an abſolute commandement of the lord, owght not to be laid aſide for a ſimple inconuenience or vncomelines of a thing, which in the own nature is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. The offence, in occaſioning the weak to fal, and the wicked to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed in their wickednes: is one of the fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ſpottes in the ſurplice, and which of al other can make yt moſte deteſtable in the eyes of a godly Miniſter. And ſuch it is in dede, that yf it were balanced with any thing le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ft free vnto vs of the lord, as in the choiſe of meates, and drinkes: yt would eaſely weigh yt down. But, when it is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id in the skoles, with the preaching of the word of god, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich is ſo neceſſary for hym that is called thereunto, that a
<pb facs="tcp:7987:137"/> wo hangeth on his head, if he doe not preach yt: yt is of les importance, then for the refuſal of yt, we should let goe ſo neceſſary a duty.</p>
               <p>As for that which is vttered againſt the offence, yt is as the<note place="margin">In the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part pa. 403.</note> reſt of this diſputation, to shew how inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniently ſuch th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges are eſtablished: not that they may not in any reſpect, be born with. And my reply to the place of the Corinth. 1. 8. againſt his anſwer, which ſaith that <hi>in thinges indifferent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by the Magiſtrate, we owght not to haue ſuch regard vnto the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the weak:</hi> owght not to be drawen further, then I alledged yt: th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at is, in applying our ſelues to our brethren, ſo that we leau not vndoen that which the lord hath abſolutely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded. where that is not, boeth in vſe of theſe indifferent thinges, and abſteyning from them: we are ſo ſtraitly bound to haue regard vnto the weak brother, as no Magiſtrate is able to lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the knot of that bond. But, where offences can not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be redemed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by leauing that vndoe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which the lord hym ſelf hath not left free vnto vs, but caſt a yoke of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſeruice vpon vs: there the caſe is otherwiſe. for if the Pr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince, vpon declaration of the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience of ſuch ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies, and hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble ſute for the releas of them, wil loſe nothing of the cord of this ſeruitude: for my part, I ſee no better way, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the weak that they be not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and prayer to god to ſtrenghthen them thereunto, to kepe on the cours of feeding the flok committed ynto him.</p>
               <p>This is, in few wordes, my ſimple iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the matter of this apparel and ſuch like ceremonies, peraduenture need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be here propounded: not ſo much for their ſakes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch mislike yt (which I ſuppoſe for the moſte part to be of th<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>at iudgment) as for them which are born in hand, that there is no other cauſe, why the Miniſters haue left their flockes, then for that they would not wear this apparel. Vuherein, beſide other matters of far greater weight, euen in this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of ceremonies: the yoke which is laid vpon their neckes, is not onely to vſe them, but to ſubſcribe vnto them, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good and conuenient orders. where, yt is not onely not lawful to ſubſcribe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but requiſite, that the Miniſter sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld, as occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſerueth, teach the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
